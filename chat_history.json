    "question": "Prime index relation in quran",
    "answer": " The prime index relation in the Quran is a mathematical phenomenon where the index of a prime number is related to a specific verse or word in the Quran. This can be seen in table 4.3, where the index + prime number = another prime number. This relation is further explored in Chapter 4.7 of the book, where it is shown that the Quranic initials have a prime index relation as well. This serves as evidence that the Quran is a manifestation of the ultimate mathematics described in the book."
