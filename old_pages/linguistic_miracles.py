    The Qur'an challenges mankind to produce even a single Surah like it (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23).  
    Despite being brief, Surah Al-Kawthar (3 verses) is rich in rhythm, depth, and eloquence—unmatched by Arabic literature.

    **Example**:  
    _"إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ"_ – Its rhythmic beauty, concise structure, and layered meanings make it impossible to replicate.

    st.subheader("2. Perfect Word Choice")
    st.markdown("""
    Arabic has multiple synonyms for many words, yet the Qur'an always uses the most contextually and emotionally appropriate one.

    **Example**:  
    The word _“بصر”_ (vision) is used when referring to external sight, while _“نظر”_ is used when deeper contemplation is meant.

    st.subheader("3. Gender-Consistent Verbs")
    st.markdown("""
    Arabic verbs change with gender. In Surah Al-Shams (91:8), the soul is grammatically feminine:
    
    _"فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا"_  
    The verb is correctly conjugated to match. This level of grammar accuracy is consistent throughout.
