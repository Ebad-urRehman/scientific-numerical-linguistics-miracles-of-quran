    **Verse**: *Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:12–14)*  
    **Arabic**:  
    `وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِن سُلَـٰلَةٍۢ مِّن طِينٍۢ ...`  
    **Translation**:  
    _"We created man from an extract of clay... then We made the drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump, and We made the lump bones, and We covered the bones with flesh..."_

    **Scientific Insight**:  
    This verse describes the stages of embryonic development with remarkable accuracy: sperm-drop → clinging clot → lump → bones → flesh. Modern embryology confirms these stages with ultrasound imaging and embryological data.

    **Reference**: Keith L. Moore, Embryologist, acknowledged the resemblance of Qur’anic descriptions to scientific knowledge.

    st.markdown("""
    **Verse**: *Surah Al-Anbiya (21:30)*  
    **Arabic**:  
    `أَوَلَمْ يَرَ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ أَنَّ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًۭا فَفَتَقْنَـٰهُمَا...`  
    **Translation**:  
    _"Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, then We split them apart..."_

    **Scientific Insight**:  
    This is a clear reference to the **Big Bang**, the widely accepted theory of how the universe began as a single point and expanded outward.

    **Reference**: Supported by Edwin Hubble’s discovery in 1929 that the universe is expanding.

    st.markdown("""
    **Verse**: *Surah Al-Hadid (57:25)*  
    **Arabic**:  
    `... وَأَنزَلْنَا ٱلْحَدِيدَ فِيهِ بَأْسٌۭ شَدِيدٌۭ ...`  
    **Translation**:  
    _"...and We sent down iron, in which is strong material and benefits for mankind..."_

    **Scientific Insight**:  
    The Qur’an says iron was “sent down”, which puzzled classical scholars. Modern science confirms that **iron is not native to Earth**—it arrived via meteorites from supernova explosions, which forged iron in the stars.

    **Reference**: NASA & Astrophysics: Iron forms in massive stars and is delivered to planets through cosmic collisions.
