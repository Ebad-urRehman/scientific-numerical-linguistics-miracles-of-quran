Introduction

The chief aim of all investigations of the external world should be to discover
the rational order and harmony which has been imposed on it by God and which
He has revealed to us in the language of mathematics. - Johannes Kepler (1571-
1630)

Over millennia humans were taught the science of mathematics by which
they could understand the nature around them, or in other words, their own
home as well as themselves. Our home happens to be so large and beautiful
that a short-lived study does not yield much knowledge and it has taken us a
long time to understand only a very minute amount about its structure. The
problem is compounded by the fact that we can only look at our home from the
inside and with a very limited view.

The fundamental tool at man’s disposal is the tool of numbers. These
numbers starting with integers, or whole numbers, seem to be the primary
system describing nature in a very basic way. The old concept of the four (4)
elements, wind, fire, water and earth is an example of assignment of numbers to

objects. After John Dalton (1766 - 1844) suggested the atomic theory of matter,
a number system seemed to be the method of describing the different masses
for different atoms. The learning process continued with Dmitriy Ivanovich
Mendeleyev (1834 - 1907) who came up with the first Periodic Table of the
Elements. Mendeleyev ordered the elements according to their increasing mass.
The system had flaws because some isotopes of a given element were heavier than
the next most abundant element. The problem was solved when Henry Moseley
(1887 - 1915) arranged the elements according to their increasing electrical
charge. This is so elegant and yet simple that even a child can utter the order of
chemical elements by simply counting numbers. So, when a child counts from 1
to 10, he or she, in effect, says Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, Boron,
Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Florine, and Neon.

0°" century the concept of Quantum Theory and discreteness of

In the early 2
mass and energy as in the case of electric charge, necessitated the proposal of yet
another number system known as Quantum numbers. These quantum numbers
such as spin, angular momentum, isospin, hyper-charge, flavor, and color do not
seem as elegant and simple as those generating the periodic table of elements,
however, they have provided us with tools to design and manufacture many new
systems we utilize in our modern life.

Our ability to count and assign numbers to various objects which were
previously unknown to us, stems from the fact that numbers pre-existed
everything else. Therefore, numbers provide the tools by which we analyze
and recognize everything.

The eternal aspect of numbers and their independence of the physical

universe or ultimately the multiverse suggests that physical existence has a
design and a purpose emanating from intelligence and therefore can be called
*creation”. In this book, we will witness a manifestation of mathematics never

seen before and which without a doubt can be called ” Ultimate Mathematics” .
Chapter 2

Ultimate Mathematics

In this chapter the reader will be introduced to a mathematics which I have
called Ultimate Mathematics. The reason for this choice of words will become
clear later on, but as a start I must say that this is a mathematics which unveils
secret properties of numbers and how primes, twin primes, composites, Gaussian
primes, Mersenne primes and other types of primes, which will be introduced
later, relate to their indices as well as how their indices relate to one another.
The mathematics uses sophisticated relations in number systems, all unknown to
us, crosses number bases and has formidable group structure. The mathematics
of primes, twin primes, composites, twin prime companions and their relations
to their respective indices as well as index relations to groups and each other
are well beyond human knowledge. The study of these mathematical relations
constitute a first time investigation of such number properties and should be

considered a historical event in our understanding of numbers.
2.1 Prime Numbers

The mathematics of prime numbers has fascinated mathematicians since humans

started to count. Prime numbers are a class of integers that are only divisible

Table 2.1: Some prime numbers with their positional indices

by themselves and one. The number one itself is not considered a prime. Some
prime numbers and their indices are shown in table 2.1.

The first order of business is to simply look at a number and decide whether
or not it is a prime. This is a monumental task since there is no algebraic
equation generating prime numbers.

The second order of business seems to be to determine if there are infinitely
many primes. This task was achieved long ago by Euclid (325BC-265BC) who
proved it in a most elegant way. This is one of the early proofs known which
utilizes the method of contradiction to establish a result.

This method of contradiction is described as following. Let us assume that
we have found the largest prime number P, we then can construct a composite C

that is the product of all prime numbers up to and including P. In other words,

C=2x3x5x7x1lx13x17x«K 19x... x P. (2.1)
Then (C + 1) is either a prime or a composite. If it is prime, then it is by far
larger than P. If it is a composite, it cannot be divisible by any of the primes in
the above product; however, it has to be factorized into primes and these prime
numbers have to be larger than the primes in the above product. We, therefore,
can always find a prime larger than an existing prime and consequently we have
infinitely many primes.

A third immediate challenge is to obtain a relation between the left and the
right numbers in table 2.1. We refer to a number in the left column of table 2.1
as the index of a prime. The index of a prime is simply its ascending positional
rank. We could, for example, ask the following question:

What is the 98” prime number?

We would not be able to spontaneously say 521, unless we generate all prime
numbers from the first prime number which is 2 to the 98°” prime which is 521.
There is, however, an approximate answer to the above question. This is due
to Gauss’ prime number theorem that relates a prime to its index through the

following relation;

,- 2 (2.2)

where the symbol ‘In’ denotes the natural logarithm. The above theorem was
proven in the 20" century. The above relation actually links the index and
its corresponding prime in an asymptotic manner and the index and the prime
approach the actual values as they tend to infinity. I must, however, emphasize
again that there is no known relation that gives the exact values of the prime

and its corresponding index.
An analytic relation of a quadratic form n?

— n+l generates primes for
values of n in the range of 0 < n < 40. Are there infinitely many primes of
this form? The same question applies to n? — 79n + 1601 which again generates
primes for 0 < n < 79. Note, although these quadratic expressions generate

primes for a given n, they do not generate the indices of these primes. In other

words, n is not the index of a generated prime.

2.2 Composites

Now let us explore another class of numbers known as composites. If we remove
all of the prime numbers from the group of integer numbers, then we are left
with composites. Composites are numbers that can be factored into primes.

For example the number 341 is a composite because

341 = 11 x 31. (2.3)

Euclid also gives a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every
integer can be written as a product of primes in an essentially unique way.
Table 2.2 shows some composites with their positional indices. Is there an exact
relation connecting a composite number to its index? The answer again, just
as in the case of primes is NO. This is because composites and primes are
connected. If we denote the index of the composite with i, and that of the

prime with 7, then the relation would be in the following manner;

ig =p—tpy—1. (2.4)
Since we do not know the exact relation between prime numbers and their indices

Table 2.2: Some composite numbers with their positional indices

in the above equation, we are unable to establish a one-to-one correspondence

between composite numbers and their indices.

2.3. Twin Primes

There is yet another class of prime numbers, differing in magnitude by ”two”,
known as twin primes. Some twin prime pairs are tabulated below in table 2.3.

Again, the first order of business is to determine if there are infinitely
many twin primes. To date, this proof is beyond our capability. Although
it makes sense that there are infinitely many twin primes, the proof has eluded
mathematicians so far. This makes the handling of twin primes a step more
formidable than primes.

Is there an approximate relation between twin primes and their indices? The
answer is yes and this relation is due to Hardy and Littlewood[1].

Where z is any of the two twin primes.

The reader should note that the above relation does not assign a given twin

prime to its index exactly, but rather predicts the general trend of twin primes.
There is also another approximate relation by the author [2] relating twin

primes and their indices.

i=— (2.6)

~ Inina

This relation does not have a constant and it is very good for predicting the
proximity of small twin primes relative to their indices.
Is there an exact relation between twin primes and their indices? The answer

again is NO. Therefore, a one-to-one correspondence between twin primes and

Table 2.4: Twin primes individually with their positional indices

their indices is only possible by generating them and tabulating them as in table
2.3.
We can also display twin primes individually with a given index. The relation

between these indices and those of table 2.3 is:
j=2-i1. (2.7)

Therefore, the twin primes individually can be listed as in table 2.4.
The reason for tabulating these numbers in such a way is to point out some of
the relations which exist among the indices of these different types of primes

and composites and will become clear later in this book.

2.4 Twin Prime Companions

Let us look at the special composites bracketed by a pair of twin primes. We have
coined the name Twin Prime Companion, or TPC, for this class of composites.

For example, consider the three numbers 3, 4 and 5, where 3 and 5 are a pair of

Table 2.5: Twin prime companions with their positional indices

twin primes and 4 is their companion, therefore, the first TPC is 4. The indices
of these composites are exactly the same as those of the twin prime pairs. Table
2.5 shows a few TPCs with their associated indices.

A close inspection of table 2.5 reveals that all these numbers, except for the
first one, that is 4, are divisible by 6 and they all end with 0, 2, and 8 except for
the first two, 4 and 6. This specific property of these numbers offers a unique
opportunity to generate twin primes without generating the primes first.

In our studies of the primes, twin primes, TPCs and their respective indices,
we found an approximate relation which we refer to as *the index of the index
relation” between twin primes and primes and their indices. For example the
25'” twin prime pair is 521 and 523, however, the indices of primes 521 and 523
are 98 and 99, respectively and there are 25 primes below 98 and 99 which is
the index of the twin prime pair (521, 523).[2]

2.5 Lonely Primes

Now let us remove all twin primes from the list of primes and what we are left
with are the lonely primes, a name we have given to these primes. Since it is
proven that there are infinitely many primes, we can then safely conclude that
there are also infinitely many lonely primes. Again, there is no known relation
between lonely primes and their respective indices. Table 2.6 shows a few lonely

primes and their indices.

2.6 Prime-Index Additive Primes

Now let us look at another class of primes. These primes are the sum of a prime
and its index. These are a subset of primes, but a lot less common than ordinary

primes. Table 2.7 shows the first 19 such primes.

2.7  Prime-Index Additive Composites

This is yet another class of numbers, more specifically another set of composites
where the composite is partitionable into a prime and its index or in other words
the addition of a prime and its index yields a composite number. Table 2.8 shows

the first 19 positionally additive composites with their associated indices.

2.8 Same-Rank Composite + Prime = Prime

There is a class of prime numbers that are partitionable into a composite plus a
prime with the same positional rank. For example, the 3"? composite is 8 and
the 3"¢ prime is 5, and 8 + 5 = 13 which is another prime. We tabulate these

prime numbers in table 2.9 with their associated indices or positional ranks.

2.9 Mersenne Primes

A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is of the form 2? — 1 where the
exponent p is itself a prime number. For example, 31 is a Mersenne prime
because it can be written as 2° — 1, which is equal to 32 - 1. Not every prime
in the exponent produces a Mersenne prime.

Mersenne primes are related to perfect numbers. Perfect numbers are
numbers that are equal to the sum of all their proper divisors. Historically,
the study of Mersenne primes was originally motivated by this relation. Euclid

discovered that the first four perfect numbers are generated by
P, = 2?-1(2? — 1) (2.8)

In the 18* century, Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form.

smallest perfect number. All perfect numbers, except 6, have a digital root of 1.
Digital root refers to consecutive additions of digits in a number. For example;
the digital root of the perfect number 28 is 2+8 = 10;1+0=1.

In table 2.10, we show some exponents of the Mersenne primes and their
number of digits as well as the number of digits of the corresponding perfect

number. This is because the numbers themselves grow very fast and are two

large to tabulate.

2.10 Gaussian Primes

Carl Friedrich Gauss was born in Brunswick (Germany) on April 30!", 1777
and was the only son of poor lower-class parents. A popular story about his
early education demonstrates his unique gifts. While in elementary school his
teacher tried to occupy naughty pupils by making them add up the integers
from 1 to 100. Little Gauss who misbehaved one day, was assigned this arduous
task. Carl, however, produced the correct answer within seconds by a flash of
mathematical genius, to the surprise of all. Gauss had figured out that pairwise
addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate
sums: 1+ 100 = 101,2+ 99 = 101,3+ 98 = 101, and so on, for a total sum of
50 x 101 = 5050.

Gauss’ contributions to the field of number theory and electromagnetism
are invaluable. Without complex numbers, we would not have the knowledge
to build any of the modern electronic devices.

If you pick up your calculator and punch in -1 and then punch the sqrt
button, you will get an error. This is because the square root of a negative
number is not defined for real numbers. However, in the complex plane we can
draw an imaginary axis and have imaginary numbers such as i, 2i, 3i, and so
on. A complex number is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number,
such as (4 + i) or (5 + 3i).

A Gaussian prime is a prime that could either be complex or real and it is
only divisible by itself, 1, -1 or i, -i. A complex number of the form (a + bi) is a
Gaussian prime if and only if a? +b? is a prime. Therefore, (4 + i) is a Gaussian

prime, however, (4 + 3i) is not. The first five real Gaussian primes are 3, 7, 11,

19, and 23; and are of the form (4n + 3), where n is any integer including 0.
Real Gaussian primes cannot be factored out into complex numbers. The
prime number 17, for example, is not a Gaussian prime, since it can be factored
out into (4+ 7)(4—7%) =17.
Now let us tabulate all real Gaussian primes. Table 2.11 shows real Gaussian
prime numbers with their associated indices as well as their indices for ordinary
primes.

2.11 Factorizing Primes in the Complex
Domain

As it is mentioned above, Quran’s system is formidable beyond our wildest
imagination. We know that primes can not be factorized in the domain of
real numbers. As a matter of fact prime numbers form a basis on which all
composites are built. In other words, every composite number can be factored
out into primes. This is mathematical rule. Factorization is not a trivial task
and it is a formidable number crunching task. Some primes can be factored out
only in the complex domain. This, known as ” unique factorization domain” can
be thought of a prime number being a sophisticated complex polynomial that
may or may not be factorized into complex numbers. These sets of complex
numbers have to be integers and are usually known, or referred to, as Gaussian
integers. An easy example of a prime factoring into Gaussian integers is the
case of primes with the following form. Fermat primes can be considered as a

subset of these primes:

p=n+1 (2.10)
Some examples of Fermat primes are 5, 17, 37, 101, and 257. Note;

ixi=-l (2.11)
2.12 Group Structure

Group properties of numbers can also be studied and sometimes they seem to
have connections with prime numbers and their indices. We demonstrate this

relation with a specific prime number 9127.

Let us look at the permutation group properties of the four digits 1, 2, 7,
and 9. We can make 4! or 24, 4-digit numbers. These are tabulated in table
2.12.

It is noteworthy that 11 numbers in the above table are prime numbers. We
will see later on in this book that there are relations between specific group

indices and primes, as well as twin primes and their respective indices.

index. They are very rare and some are tabulated below in table 2.13.

2.15 Twin TPC

Twin TPCs are a pair of consecutive TPCs, differing in magnitude by 6, such
as (6,12), (12,18), (102, 108) and so on. These numbers grow very rapidly
in magnitude. It is very instructive to study these numbers and their indexal

relations. Table 2.15 shows some of these twin TPCs.
2.16 Summary

These specific numbers and their respective indices constitute numerical
relations and properties never studied before. In chapter 4 of this book we
will witness a literary work called the Quran which is a manifestation of the

mathematics I have described in this chapter.

23
Chapter 3

The Quran, an Introduction

The Quran, meaning “recitation” in Arabic, was revealed on the 27" night of
the 9” month, Ramadan, of the lunar calendar in the year 610 AD. The first
verse of the Quran is; po oP al ft meaning ”In the name of God, The
All Gracious, The All Merciful”. This verse is at the beginning of every sura
or chapter, except for sura 9 and it is mentioned twice in sura 27. Throughout
this book, I refer to this verse as ” Bismallah”.

The Quran has 114 chapters or suras, 6234 numbered verses, and 6346 total
verses. The 112 un-numbered verses are the Bismallah’s starting each sura
except for sura 9 as mentioned above, sura one which is verse number one,
and sura 27 where it is mentioned in verse 30. At a quick glance, the number
of verses in each sura and therefore their length do not seem to follow any
particular pattern but the underlying structure becomes clear once the reader
finishes this book.

A unique aspect of the Quran, never seen in any other book or work of

literature, is that 29 of its suras are prefixed with a number of Arabic letters

which do not make up any known word in the Arabic language. These Arabic

24
letters are referred to, first by R. Khalifa [3], as the Quranic initials, and the
suras as the initialed suras. As we shall see from the mathematics described
in the previous chapter, the Arabic letters in these Quranic initials and their
respective frequency of their occurrence in these suras are generated by the
Ultimate Mathematics described in chapter two. The eternal aspect of the
mathematics points to the fact that God’s system is immutable as the Quran
asserts.

The total number of the word *God” or ” Allah” in the Quran is 2698. The
frequency of occurrence of every word in the Quran is mathematically generated
and positioned in the specific sura or verse according to the generators in chapter
two of this book. These parameters are based on sura 9 having 127 verses. We
will see in this book that the mathematics described in chapter two of this book
does not generate verses 9:128 and 9:129, and points to sura 9 having 127 verses
only.

Another mathematical structure of the Quran, which again is generated
by the Ultimate Mathematics, described in chapter two, is the order of the
revelation of suras. This order is tabulated below in table 3.1 obtained from
Appendix 23 of an English translation of the Quran by Rashad Khalifa.[3]
Table 3.1 also generates two more tables because of the unique structure of the
Quran which contains the initialed suras. These suras and their un-initialed
counterparts have a revelation and compilation order shown in the following
two tables 3.2 and 3.3.

The literal Arabic structure of the Quran is a beautiful and concise collection

of commandments, words of wisdom, good news, and warnings. It also contains

examples and narrations of historical events relating to Adam, Noah, Abraham,
Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, and many other Prophets and Messengers such as
Joseph, Jonah, Judah, Zachariah, John, and righteous women such as Mary and
Pharaoh’s wife as well as stories of the unfaithful such as Pharaoh, Abraham’s
father, Lot’s wife, Noah’s wife and many more.

For approximately 1350 solar years, this literary work stood the test of time
by its shear literal beauty. Scholars and students of the Quran meticulously
wrote down every word and counted the number of each letter and word in the
Quran. These endeavors finally bore fruit in 1974, when Rashad Khalifa, a Ph.D.
biochemist noted that a 19-based mathematical code governs the underlying
structure of the Quran. His works were published in 1981 and were also referred
to in an article in Scientific American by the noted number theorist Martin
Gardner (1914 - 2010) in which he called Dr. Khalifa’s work ”an ingenuous
study of the Quran.”

The mathematics described in this book goes well beyond the work of Rashad

Khalifa and will offer clear evidence that not only is the Quran a manifestation
of the mathematics described in chapter two, but it is impossible to be imitated
since we have no knowledge of the primes, twin primes, composites, Gaussian
primes, Mersenne primes, and their associated indices as well as relations among
the indices of these primes. Furthermore, the reader should appreciate that
the mathematics presented here, for the first time, reveals intricate relations
between specific numbers and their positional index or rank and how they can

be connected to number base systems and mathematical groups.
3.1 The Arabic Alphabet and Gematria

The Arabic language is one of the oldest languages derived from a Semitic
root and is closely related to Hebrew both in semantics as well as grammatical
structure. The Arabic alphabet has 28 letters and each letter has a ” gematria”
value assigned to it, very similar to Hebrew. Note that the Hebrew alphabet
contains 22 letters, while the Greek alphabet has 24 letters and the classical
Latin alphabet contains 23 letters. The gematria values of the Arabic alphabet
is shown in the following table 3.4.

This number system provides a gematria value for every Arabic word. This
word value is not unique to each word and more than one word can have the
same gematria value. For example, the Arabic word dels meaning ”one” has a

gematria value of 19 as does ors, meaning ” guidance”.
3.2. Numbers mentioned in the Quran

There are 30 integer numbers mentioned in the Quran, at least once. These

numbers are tabulated in table 3.5. Thirteen numbers out of these thirty

Quran: Manifestation of the
Ultimate Mathematics

4.1 Over it is 19

Chapter or sura 74, verse 30 of the Quran is the foundation upon which
a humanly impossible mathematically coded literary work is built. This sura
entitled ”The Hidden Secret” informs us that those who claim the Quran is
man-made will be proven wrong by the number 19.

The code is supportive and indicative of the underlying message of the Quran
advocating worship of God alone.

The number 19 is acting as a beacon along the way to guide the reader
through the maze of numbers lest one would never be able to decipher the
intricate Ultimate Mathematics of the Quran.

The mathematics guaranties the fact that the Quran cannot be man-made
and it cannot be altered, since it is not just "ink” and ” paper”. We shall see the
mathematics described in chapter two of this book serves as the generator for

the Quran. Therefore, since the mathematics of numbers is the eternal truth,

34
the Quran has to be the eternal truth. As Galileo stated, "mathematics is the
language with which God has written the universe”.

ACCORDING TO THE MATHEMATICS INTRODUCED IN CHAPTER
TWO, THE QURAN HAS ALWAYS EXISTED AND IT IS OUTSIDE
THE PHYSICAL DIMENSIONS OF THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN.
ULTIMATE MATHEMATICS TOOK THE FORM OF A BOOK, CALLED
THE QURAN, NEARLY 1400 SOLAR YEARS AGO. IT CAN SAFELY BE
CONCLUDED THAT THE QURAN IS THE LITERAL EMBODIMENT OF
THE ULTIMATE MATHEMATICS DESCRIBED IN CHAPTER TWO AND
CAN ONLY BE AUTHORED BY GOD.

This is also a manifestation of an encompassing knowledge through
the Ultimate Mathematics of primes numbers and their indices, and
prime derivatives such as composites, twin primes, twin prime companions,
partitionable numbers, lonely primes and their respective indices or positional
ranks, TPCs, Twin TPCs, and Gaussian Primes. This is to inform us that not
only is the Quran mathematically coded, but it is coded with a mathematics
impossible for us to manipulate. The formidability of the code cannot be
duplicated, imitated or emulated by anyone.

The function of Ultimate Mathematics, described in chapter two of this book,

is to serve as the protected tablet for the Quran and is designed:

e to generate the counts of the Quranic initials,

e to generate the number of verses in each and every chapter of the Quran,

e and to prove that the Quran is a manifestation of the Ultimate

35
Mathematics.

The best way to introduce this formidable code is to show examples of how

the mathematics described in chapter two generates the Quran.

4.2 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Six suras
and their Number of Verses

Here are awesome mathematical relations based on the Ultimate Mathematics
of Primes, Composites, their respective indices, group structures and number
base systems providing proof that the Quran is the truth. To prove this, we

start with the 19'” Mersenne Prime (MP). MPs are of the following form;

MP =2?-1; (4.1)

where the exponent p is a prime number. Note p is not just any prime
number; only specific primes yield MPs. As described in chapter two, we find
the exponent of the 19%” MP to be 4253. The MP itself is a very large number
with 1281 digits and was discovered by Hurwitz in 1961.

Now let us look at the permutation group properties of the four digits 2, 3,

4, and 5 in table 4.1

The group element 19 is 5234 which is also a composite with an index of
4537. The group element 22 is 5342 and it is a composite with an index of 4635.
Note, we started with 4253 as the exponent of the 19‘” MP. The index of prime
number 19 is 8. If we assume that 4253 is in base 8 then written in base 10 it
will be 2219. That is why group elements 19 and 22 are important to look at.

Table 4.1 has just generated the chapter or sura numbers and their associated
number of verses for four suras in the Quran. 4253 is telling us that sura 42
has 53 verses, 4537 is telling us sura 45 has 37 verses, 4635 tells us that sura
46 has 35 verses and the 9" group element in table 4.1 is 3425 which is the
index of composite 3975 and it tells us that sura 39 has 75 verses. The 20¢”
group element 5243 is the index of 6123 and in the Quran the number of verses
from 1:1 to 96:19 is exactly 6123. Also note that 6123 is the 19'” group element
in the permutation of the 4 digits 1, 2, 3, and 6. Table 4.2 shows all the 24
permutation group elements of the above four digits.

Now let us see if we can generate 96 having 19 verses from the above two

tables 4.1 and 4.2. First, we note that the index of composite 1362 is 1143 and

1143 = 9 x 127. (4.2)

We note that chapter 9 has 127 verses. But also the number of verses in the

Quran from 1:1 to 9:127 is exactly 1362 [5]. Going back to the 19” group

elements in tables 4.1 and 4.2, we have 6123 and 5234. The difference between

these two numbers is;
6123 — 5234 = 889. (4.3)

Writing 889 in base 9 we have 1187, i.e., (889)19 = (1187)9. We find the 1187"
prime number is 9619. This is telling us that sura 96 has 19 verses. Also, 1187

is a lonely prime and its index is 114, the number of suras in the Quran.

4.3. Ultimate Mathematics Generates’ the
Number of Initials in the Quran

Here are awesome mathematical relations based on the Ultimate Mathematics
of Primes, Composites, and their respective indices, group structures producing
and proving the Quran as the manifestation of the Ultimate mathematics
described in Chapter two of this book.

To prove this, we start with table 4.3.

38
Table 4.3: Positional additive primes

index | index + prime = prime

1 1+2=3
2 24+3=5

” 799099

” 799099

114 | 808 + 6211 = 7019

” ”

”

Remember our beacon is the number 19. Look at the 19" positional additive
prime highlighted in bold. We note immediately that sura 19 has 98 verses.
Furthermore, 619 is the 114‘ prime and 114 is exactly the number of chapters
in the Quran. Now let us focus on the 114” positional additive prime. We note
that 6211 is a very important number in the Quran. The reader can verify that
sura 62 has 11 verses. Table 4.3 has just generated chapter or sura numbers
and their associated number of verses for two suras in the Quran, namely 19:98
and 62:11. Now let us see how 6211 generates the number of H.M.’s in the 7
H.M. initialed suras 40-46. The 6211'” composite is 7124. Table 4.4 shows the
permutation group elements of 7, 1, 2, and 4.

Note 7124 is the 19'” group element in the permutation of the 4 digits 1, 2,
4, and 7.

Remember there are 7 e>-initialed chapters. The 7" group element

highlighted in boldface is 2147. The number

2147 = 19 x 113, (4.4)

39

12 2741 (p) 24 7421

is exactly the number of the frequency of cs + Ps (H’s + M’s) in these 7 suras.
The 7'" prime number is 17 and the 17'” group element is 4712. If we add these

two numbers, we have
2147 + 4712 = 6859 = 19 x 19 x 19. (4.5)

Group elements 15 and 16 are also important. 4217 is the number of verses from
1:1 to 41:1 and 4271 is the number of verses from 1:1 to 42:1 and 4271 belongs
to the 114” twin prime pair, i.e., (4271, 4273).

Therefore, these numbers already speak the Quran. The physical Quran is

simply a written manifestation of the eternal laws of God.

4.4 Prime-Index Relation: ”By the even and
the odd”, Quran, 89:3

The Quran’s 19-based mathematical code manifests itself in different forms. It

provides clear evidence that the Quran is an unaltered literary work and as it

40
is stated, no falsehood can enter it. The aspect that I will be explaining to the
reader here is based on a single verse in the Quran which contains only two
Arabic words! Translations to other languages may contain more than two, for
example, the English translation of this verse would contain six words. The
verse is in sura 89 called "The Dawn’. In verse three (3) of this sura, God takes
an oath by ” THE EVEN AND THE ODD.” At first, this may sound meaningless
to the casual reader of the Quran. However, by studying the numbers, we realize
this is truly a profound oath. Let me explain how. Note that the concatenation
of sura number and verse number is 893 which is a multiple of 19. As a matter
of fact, it is 893 = 47 x 19. We would like to focus on the properties of the
integer 47. The number 47 happens to also be a prime number. The number 47
can be partitioned into 19 + 28. The number 28 is another interesting number
mathematically because it is the second ” Perfect” number in the number system.
The first perfect number is 6. Remember the number of chapters in the Quran
is 114 =6 x 19. What are perfect numbers? A perfect number is a number for
which the sum and the multiples of its factors are equal to itself. For example,
6 = 1+2+3 and also 6 = 1 x 2 x 3. As I mentioned above, the second
perfect number is 28 and the third is 496 and so on. Remember that God
created the skies and the land in ”6 Days”. He sent the Quran in a PERFECT
ARABIC TONGUE. The second perfect number 28 happens to be the number
of characters in the Arabic alphabet.

Let me now go back to the EVEN and the ODD. Let us look at the number
of verses in each chapter and see if it is odd or even? If we do this, we find

that there are 60 chapters in the Quran which possess an even number of verses

41
and 54 which possess an odd number of verses. Of course if you add these two
numbers you obtain 114. However, the intricacy of the Quran’s mathematical
code becomes more overwhelming if we examine these numbers as the indices
of Prime numbers. Therefore, the 54'” prime number is 251 and the 60" prime

number is 281. Now let us add them up.

251 + 281 = 532 (4.6)

and,

532 = 28 x 19. (4.7)

We also note that there are 112 verses in the Quran which are not numbered.
These are the opening statements, i.e., Bismallah’s which are in the beginning
of every chapter except for chapter 9. What happens if we include these verses
in the total number of verses in each chapter? We obtain 52 even numbers and
62 odd numbers. The 52”¢ prime number is 239 and the 62”¢ prime number is

293. Let us add them up,

239 + 293 = 532 (4.8)

and,

532 = 28 x 19. (4.9)

We have two pairs of prime numbers 251, 281 and 239, 293. Let us add all the
digits in these two pairs.

42
24+5+1+4+24+8+1=19 (4.10)
and,
24+34+9+4+24+94+3=28. (4.11)

Again, we are back to 19 and 28.

4.4.1 The word Wl (Allah) or God

Shown in table 3.4 is the Arabic alphabet. There are two ways one can number
them. One is sequentially, 1 through 28 and the other way is the universally
known gematrical values. Both numbers are shown in table 3.4 next to the
Arabic letters.

Now let us calculate the sum of letters in the word ail (Allah), both
sequentially and gematrically. They are 30 and 66, respectively. As we know 30
is the 19!" composite. There are 38 numbers in the Quran, including fractions.
In ascending order 30 is the 23" number in the Quran. Again from table 3.4, if
we spell out the word ” Alone” or 049, pronounced ” Wahdahu”, in both number
systems, we get 23. Therefore, this number system in the Quran proclaims God
Alone. It is interesting that since the word ”alone” in Arabic is made up of the
first 10 letters of the alphabet, it yields the same sum in both number systems.
As we will see this has far reaching mathematical consequences. Look at chapter

30 and you see that the sum of the frequencies of the usages of the initials ii is
1254 = 19 x 66. (4.12)

Le
Note the sequential and the gematrical value of the word aU pronounced ‘Allah’.

This chapter has 60 verses. Number 60 is the 42”¢ composite and 42 is the 23"¢

43
initialed chapter or sura in the Quran. Remember that 30 is the 23’¢ number

in the Quran.

4.5 Guidance is from God Alone

It is repeated throughout the Quran that God is the ”One” who guides. This
is why Abraham, for example, was unable to guide his own father. Remember
also the story of Lot’s wife and Noah’s wife and his presumed son. In the
case of Abraham’s father, Abraham went as far as making a mistake in praying
for forgiveness on his father’s behalf. The Arabic word for guidance is ss,
pronounced ”huda” and it is one of the important keywords mentioned by God
in the Quran right after the first sura, ”The Opener”. If you look at the second
sura in the Quran, you find that it is the longest sura in the Quran and it is
detailed with laws and commandments for the betterment of mankind, here now
and forever. It is called ” The Heifer”, as a symbol of submission to God. It is
the first initialed sura in the Quran and its second verse informs us that this
scripture is infallible and it is a beacon ge (huda) for the righteous. The word
ge in Arabic has three letters, 0, > and Ss The gematrical or the sequential
values of these letters are 5, 4 and 10 and if you add them up you get 19.
This is a mathematical confirmation that only God and God alone guides. It is
noteworthy that since Arabic is written from right to left, if we write this word
and concatenate the values of the letters we get 1045, which is equal to 55 x 19.
Furthermore, the 5519'” composite is 6346 which is the total number of verses in
the Quran. We note that sura 55 is called all meaning ” The All Gracious” ,

and its second verse informs us that He teaches the Quran. Verse 55:19 is a

prime-numbered verse and it is the 1273" such verse from the beginning of the

Quran which happens to be the frequency of the word God up to 9:127.

4.6 Number 100

Number 100 has a very special place in the Quran. For example, it tells us that
19, the Quran mathematical group generator, had to be mentioned in 74:30. If
we look at all the numbers in the Quran we note that number 100 is the 30*”
number. We know that 30 is the 19” composite. Number 100 is also the 74‘”
composite and therefore we are back to 74:30 which tells us *OVER IT IS 19”.
Table 4.5 shows all numbers mentioned in the Quran.

THEOREM:

Assume we have a pair of two-digit numbers, ab and cd such that a, b, c and d

45
are nonzero. If ab + cd = 100, thena+b+c+d=19
PROOF:

We can write two-digit numbers in polynomial form ax + b and cx + d; where
in decimal number system x2 = 10. If az +b+ca+d= 100, then we must have
b+d= 10. This implies that az + ca = 90. When we add the digits together,
we actually ignore the base 10, and this implies that 90 will change to 9 and
therefore, 10 +9 = 19. It is noteworthy that there are 72 such two-digit pairs
and 72 is the 8" TPC and 8 is the index of prime number 19. Chapter 72 has
28 verses and 72:28 is one of the numbers conforming to the above theorem,
meaning that 72+ 28 = 100 and 7+2+2+8= 19. Please read 72:28. In light
of the above theorem, it is essential to analyze chapter 100 in the Quran. We
note that it has 11 verses. If we concatenate 100 and 11 we get 10011 which is
composed of Os and 1s only. Therefore, we can think of it as a binary number.
The number 10011 in the binary number system is 19 in decimal system. Note
here the intricate mathematics, 11 is the 19° number in the Quran, and we
just saw the relation between 100 and 19. There is only one other chapter in
the Quran such that when you concatenate the sura number and the number
of verses you get a number which is composed of Os and Is and it is chapter
101 which also has 11 verses. The number 10111 in binary number system is 23
in decimal system. We know that the 23’¢ number in the Quran is 30 and the
30% number in the Quran is 100 and 30 is the 19%" composite and many more

relations between 23 and 30 which were discussed previously.

46
4.7 Prime Numbers and the Quranic Initials

The counts of single letters in the Quranic initials are very interesting from the
point of view of primes and signify important Quranic numbers. If we look at
the counts of letters in the Quranic initials, we note that there are 14 prime
numbers (excluding repetitions). This corresponds to the 14 sets of Quranic
initials. These numbers are 19, 29, 31, 53, 97, 137, 173, 251, 257, 317, 347,
1249, 1319, 2521 [3]. Note that the smallest number is 19 and the largest
number is 2521. Remember that chapter 2 has 19 x 521 usage of the Arabic
letters 1(A), J (L), and ¢ (M).

One notes that three digits namely 0, 6 and 8 are excluded from the above
list of numbers. Now if we add the above prime numbers, the sum is 6800,
exclusively made up of the missing digits. Keep in mind that 68 x 100 tells us
that the last initialed sura is 68 and 100 being the 74” composite and the 30”
number in the Quran proclaims 74:30 which tells us about 19, by stating ” over

it is 19”.

4.8 More ”Ultimate Mathematics”

The fact that sura 2, the first initialed sura in the Quran has 9899 As + Ls + Ms
or 19 x 521, is truly a numbering system beyond the capability of humans and
jinns combined. What we are about to see is that the coefficient of 19 which is
521 actually predicts the last initialed sura which is 68. We note that the 521%
TPC is 33768. This is truly an amazing number, because it is the concatenation
of the prime number 337 and 68 where 68 is the index of prime number 337.

Furthermore, in decimal to octal base conversion, we have; (337)19 = (521)s.

Chapter 44 in the Quran is called "The Smoke”. Sura 44 is one of the eo
(H.M.)-initialed suras. If we look at the counts of c (Ha) and ° (Meem), we
find that there are 16 cs 150 P's and a total of 166 cs + Ps All these numbers
including the sura number are composites. The index of 44 is 29, the index of 16
is 9, the index of 150 is 114, the index of 166 is 127. These numbers in this sura
are telling us mathematically that there is a book (Quran) with 114 chapters

and 29 of them are initialed and its 9'” chapter has 127 verses.

4.10 Over It is Nineteen

The permutation group properties of Quranic numbers as it is related to specific
primes and their indices constitute a major component of the Quran’s Ultimate
Mathematics. The 3" and the 16" permutation group elements of 7430 (verse
74:30 tells us “over it is nineteen”) are divisible by 19 and that 3+ 16 = 19.
There are six primes in these 24 permutations and their group elements add up
to 67 which as we know by now is the 19” prime number.{5]. After a careful
look at these permutation group elements, we find that this group tells us a lot
more! Let me make a table and try to explain it to you.

The 8" prime number is 19 and let us add the 8'” group element and the

igh group element. We have;
3074 + 7034 = 10108 = (19 x 19 x 28). (4.13)

Where 28 is the second perfect number and the number of letters in the Arabic

alphabet. In Table 4.6, six of the 24 numbers are prime numbers. If we add up

48
Table 4.6: Permutation group elements of 7430 with their ascending positional
indices

10 3470 22 7340
11 3704 23 7403
12 3740 24 7430

the indices of the 6 primes you get;
69 + 132 + 479 + 561 + 635 + 906 = 2782. (4.14)

Verse 27:82 states:

And when the promise comes to pass, We bring out a creature out of the
ground that speaks to them, saying that indeed the people are not certain about
Our signs.

Furthermore, if we count inclusively from 2782 to 9127, we get 6346, which

is the number of verses in the Quran.

4.11 Ultimate Mathematics, Continued

With the Quranic importance of the ”octal” or base eight number system, we
have noted a few awesome mathematical relations between key Quranic numbers
independent of a numerical base system. Let us focus on two numbers 114

(6 x 19) and 152 (8 x 19). Let us assume that someone comments that it is not

49
transparent, by looking at these numbers if they are written in base ten, eight or
six. This is a valid comment and the burden of the proof is on us to show that
no matter what base, these numbers are revealing key information about the
Quran. Let us assume the following assumptions. We make these assumptions

since the coefficients of 19 are 6 and 8:

e Assume both 114 and 152 are written in base 6, then in base 10 we have

46 and 68.

46 +68 = 114 (4.15)

e Assume that 114 is in base 6 and 152 is in base 8, then in base 10 we have

46 and 106, respectively. Note that:

46 + 106 = 152 (4.16)

e Let us assume that both are in base 8, then in base 10 we have 76 and

106, respectively. Note that,

76 + 106 = 182 (4.17)

182 is a very important number in Quran’s Ultimate Mathematics. It is the
index of prime number 1091. Number 1091 is the gematrical value of the word
Ramadan, the month the Quran was revealed. Furthermore, 1091 is the number
of the word al (Allah) or God in the initialed suras. If we add 1091 to its index
182 we get 1273 (19 x 67). We know that 19 is the index of prime number 67. We
also know that 67 is the number of times the word jg (pronounced ”salaat”
meaning contact prayer) has been mentioned in the Quran. A very important

50
role of 1273 is to keep the number of the word wl (Allah) or God in check up

to the end of chapter 9, or 9:127.

4.12 Chapters 9 and 27, Missing Bismallah and
the Extra Bismallah

Base eight showed us that, although it is not transparent from a number which
base it is written in, the key Quranic numbers such as 19, 76, 114, 152, 337, 352,
431, 521, etc... transform in a way to preserve Quranic facts. Let me repeat
what we already know about chapters 9 and 27, with regards to the missing
Opening Statement (Bismallah) and the extra Bismallah. We know that from

9 to 27 there are 19 chapters, inclusively. We also know that;

9+10+11+12413+144+15+16+17+18+19+204 21 (4.18)

4224234 244+254264+27=342 (4.19)

And 342 = 18 x 19. Furthermore, 342 is exactly the number of Arabic words
between the first and the second Bismallah in sura 27/3]. We also know that
number 9 is explicitly mentioned twice in chapter 27, namely 27:12 and 27:48.
The proximity of these two verses with respect to the extra Bismallah in 27:30 is
designed such that from 12 to 30 there are 19 verses inclusively and also between
30 and 48. Moreover, 27 + 12 + 27 + 30+ 27+48 = 171 =9 x 19 [4]. Again
we see that the coefficient of 19 is 9. All these are pointing to the direction of
some mathematical relation between 9 and 342. Now, let us assume that 342
was actually in base 9 instead of base 10. If we were to transform 342 from base

9 to base 10 we get 281, or;

(342)9 = (281)y0. (4.20)

51
The reader may verify that 281 belongs to the 19!” twin prime pair and it
is the index of composite 352 which is the gematrical value of the word ol;

(Quran) and if written in octal it is 431, or
(281)19 = (431)s. (4.21)

Note 431 is the gematrical value of the word ob ) 8 (Furqan) meaning statute

book. Also, 352 written in base 9 is 431; i.e.,
(352)10 = (431)o. (4.22)

Note Ramadan is the 9% month of the Hijri lunar calendar and Quran was

revealed in Ramadan.

4.13 Counts of Letters, Manifestation of
Ultimate Mathematics

Let us look at the number of initials 2 (a.L.M.) in suras 29 and 31. These two
suras are twin primes and their indices are 10 and 11, respectively. What we
are about to discover together is that every digit assigned to a number in the
Quran is designed according to the Ultimate Mathematics described in chapter
two, and if the Quran mentions 2 for example, it means 2 and not 1 + 1. Table
4.7 shows the counts of |, dj, and ° (A’s, L’s and M’s) in suras 29 and 31 and the
counts of |, d, and , (A, L and R) in chapters 10 and 11 are shown in table 4.8.

Note that both 10 and 11 contain the same number of initials. There
are several awesome mathematical relations in table 4.8 as was mentioned

previously. Now let us look deeper into tables 4.7 and 4.8, and sum up the

52
Sura Number | Frequency | Frequency | Frequency Sum
of | of J of P
29 774 554 344 1672 = 19 x 88
31 347 297 173 817 = 19 x 43

Table 4.7: Frequencies of the usage of letters i J, and ? in suras 29 and 31

Sura Number | Frequency | Frequency | Frequency Sum
of | of J of 5
10 1319 913 257 2489 = 19 x 131
11 1370 794 325 2489 = 19 x 131

Table 4.8: Frequencies of the usage of letters iN J, and in suras 10 and 11

digits of the initials. We have:

(sura29)7++7+4+54+54+44+3+4+4+4=43 (4.23)
(sura31)3+4+74+24+9+74+1+7+3=43 (4.24)
(sural0)1+3+1+9+4+9+4+14+3+4+2+4+5+4+7=41 (4.25)
(surall1)1+3+7+0+4+74+94+44+3+4+2+5=41 (4.26)

Just the fact that we started with the twin primes 29 and 31 and ended up with
41 and 43 the next twin primes, is amazing; but there is a lot more. Number 43
is the key. This number is related to 2489. Sura 43 is the 24*” initialed sura and
sura 43 has 89 verses and note that the 24*” prime number is 89. Furthermore,
41 is the 13” prime number and sura 13 has 43 verses. Also note that the total
frequency of the Arabic letter ? in the eo initialed chapters, from 43 to 46, is
899 = 29 x 31 [4] which goes back to suras 29 and 31 which we started with.
The number of c is 127 which is the 31% prime number. We already know that

127 + 899 = 1026 = 19 x 54 where 54 is the sum of all digits making up the

53
frequencies of c and e from sura 43 to 46 [5].

Now, let us concatenate 899 and 127, we get 899127. Remember we started
with 43, therefore, if we further concatenate 43 and 899127, we get: 43899127.
One would recognize this as the reaffirmation that sura or chapter 43 has 89
verses and sura or chapter 9 has 127 verses. Note here that a concatenation of
899 and 127 in the above manner is only possible for a language which is written

from right to left such as Arabic.
4.14 Awesome Mathematical Relation

Chapter 36 of the Quran has a special place in the Quran. It is an initialed
sura and it is the 19*” initialed sura in the Quran. The count of the frequencies
of the letters S (ya) plus (y (seen) in this chapter is 285 = 19 x 15. But why
15 as the coefficient of 19? This all goes back to the Ultimate Mathematics of
the Quran. Let me recap what we already know. Number 19 is the 8" prime
number and 15 is the 8” composite. We also know that 36 is the sum of all
integers up to and including 8 or the arithmetic series of numbers up to 8. This

means:
14+2+34+4+5+6+7+8=36. (4.27)

If we concatenate 19 and its index 8 we get 198. The 152"¢ composite happens
to be 198 and 152 = 19 x 8. If we concatenate 15 and its index 8 we get 158
which is the 120" composite and 120 = 15 x 8 [5]. The uniqueness of this
mathematics is mind boggling. Let us look at the relation between chapter 8
and chapter 36 in the Quran. A concatenation of 8 and 36 yields 836 = 19 x 44.

We note that the 44*" revelation is sura 19. The number of verses in chapter 8

54
is 75 and the number of verses in chapter 36 is 83.
83+ 75 = 158. (4.28)

Number 158 is the 120°” composite and 120 = 15 x 8. The same is true for the
case of the 19*” un-initialed sura which is 39. Sura 39 also has 75 verses. The
15‘ initialed sura in the Quran is 29 and it has 69 verses. The 19*” initialed

sura 36 has 83 verses. We therefore have;
69 + 83 = 152 (4.29)
and

152=19x8 (4.30)

and the 152”¢ composite is 198.

4.15 Counts of Letters are Connected to the
Frequency of the Word God

We looked at the number of initials ?! (A.L.M.) in suras 29 and 31. What
we discovered is that every digit assigned to a number in the Quran is a
manifestation of the Ultimate mathematics described in chapter two, and if the
Quran mentions 2 for example, it means 2 and not 1 + 1. Above, I described
the awesome connection between the counts of if dj, and P (A, L, and M) in suras
29 and 31 and the counts of i J, and ° (A, L, and M) in chapters 10 and 11.
We noted that both 10 and 11 contain the same number of initials. When we
looked deeper into these numbers, and summed up the digits of the initials, we

55
found:

(sura29)7 +7+44+5+5+4+3+4+4=43 (4.31)
(sura31)3 +4+7+24+9+7+14+74+3=43 (4.32)
(sural0)1+3+1+9+94+14+3+4+2+5+7=41 (4.33)
(surall)1+3+7+0+4+74+94+44+3+4+2+4+5=41. (4.34)

Note here that 41 is a prime number and its index is 13 and chapter 13 has
43 verses. If we look at the frequency of the word God in the Quran we reach
the 2489" word God in chapter 58. We note that chapter 58 is the only sura
in the Quran in which the word God is mentioned in every verse at least once.
We know that the number of i J, and e (A, L, and M) in suras 10 and 11 are
2489 = 19 x 131. The 2489*” frequency of the word God is the last word God
mentioned in the last verse, 58:22. But how is this connected to chapters 10
and 11? Note both 58 and 22 are composites. They happen to be the 41% and

3th

13'” composites respectively, and the 13*” prime is 41 and sura 13 has 43 verses,

thus we are back to suras 10, 11, 29 and 31.

4.16 Number of Verses and Sura Numbers

There are mathematical relations amongst four suras in the Quran that
absolutely overwhelms the mind. These four suras are 8, 19, 36 and 39. The
first property of these suras is that they are all somehow related to 19. First, 8
is the index of prime number 19. Sura 36 is the 19” initialed sura in the Quran.
Sura 39 is the 19” un-initialed sura in the Quran. In table 4.9, we show these
suras with their corresponding number of verses.

Now let us do the following exercise on the sura number and the number of

56
Sura number | Number of verses
8 75
19 98
36 83
39 75

Table 4.9: Sura numbers with their corresponding number of verses

verses for each sura. Sura number plus number of verses and number of verses
minus sura number.

8+ 75 = 83 (4.35)

75 —8=67 (4.36)
Note that 67 is the 19'” prime and 83 is the 23™¢ prime. Furthermore, 19 written
in octal or base 8 is 23 or (19)19 = (23)g. Again, the same exercise as above,
sura number plus number of verses and number of verses minus sura number,

19+ 98 = 117 (4.37)

98 —19 = 79. (4.38)
Note that 79 written in octal is 117. In sura 19, the word God has been
mentioned 8 times. If we concatenate 79, 98 and 117 with 8 we get; 798 = 19x42,
988 = 19 x 52, and 1178 = 19 x 62. Note that 798 is the total frequency of
the usage of the initials ae composed of five Arabic letters and pronounced
Kaaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Saad in sura 19. Once more, sura number plus number of
verses and number of verses minus sura number,

36 + 83 = 119 (4.39)

83 — 36 = 47. (4.40)

We already know that sura 36 called 4 (YaSeen) has 285 usage of the letter

57
Us plus the letter uv and 285 = 19 x 15 and that 19 is the 8” prime number
and 15 is the 8‘” composite number. We also know that the arithmetic series of

sequential integers until 8 is 36, in other words,
36 =14+24+34+4+5+4+64+7+8. (4.41)

The equation for the arithmetic series for any number n is;

s= - (4.42)

It happens that 47 is 39 written in base 8 and 119 is 167 written in base 8.
Furthermore, the 39'” prime number is 167. Again sura number plus number

of verses and number of verses minus sura number we get;
39+ 75 = 114 (4.43)
75 — 39 = 36 (4.44)

Now 39 goes back to the Quran containing 114 suras and the 19” initialed sura,

36.

4.17 The Extra ”Opening Statement” in Sura
27

If we count all the verses that contain the word God from 27:30 where the second

Bismallah is mentioned in sura 27, there are 19 such verses to the end of this
sura. These verses are 30, 36, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65,

79, 87, 88, and 93. If we add these verse numbers we get;
1121 =19 x 59. (4.45)

Note that 19 is the 8‘” prime and 59 is the 17” prime number. Verse 8:17 in the
Quran emphasizes that everything is controlled by God.|[4]

58
4.18 God is” The One”: Awesome Mathematics

The Quran asserts (74:31) that the implementation of the most sophisticated
mathematical system in the Quran is to establish reassurance in the mind of
those who sincerely seek the truth. The word s&% pronounced ”wahid” and
meaning “one” referring to the ”Oneness” of God has been mentioned in the
Quran 19 times. One can verify this in any of the concordances of the Quran.
However, I should emphasize that the word ”one” is not one of God’s most
beautiful names, because of its generality. God has reserved for Himself the word
*The One” or in Arabic s& rl pronounced ” Al-wahid” as one of His attributes.
We know that every letter in the Quran is there for a reason and it has been
supported with the exact science of mathematics. Out of the 19 times that the
word one refers to the Oneness of God, 6 times are” The One” referring directly
as one of God’s most beautiful names. We therefore have a case of 6 out of
19 times and I want to remind the reader to focus on 619 which is the 114*”
prime number and 114 = 6 x 19. The word, ” The One” is mentioned in 12:39,
13:16, 14:48, 38:65, 39:4, and 40:16. If we add all these sura numbers and verse

numbers, we get:

12+39+13+16+14+ 48+ 38+65+39+4+40+16=344. (4.46)

The number 344, since it is an even number, is easy to recognize as a
composite and it happens to be the 275" composite. If we add 344 to its

index 275, we get;

275 + 344 = 619, (4.47)

Table 4.10: Initialed suras up to and including sura 27

which is the 114” prime number.

4.19 Ultimate Mathematics: Another Awesome
Mathematical Relation

The mathematical structure we are about to learn together is in conjunction
with sura 19, the only sura in the Quran with five (5) Arabic letters in its set
of initials yan pronounced Kaaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Saad. Table 4.10 shows the
initialed suras up to and including sura 27.

If you count all the numbered verses up to and including sura 19 we get
2346 which is the 1998” composite and we know that chapter 19 has 98 verses
[5]. Now further proof is how 2346 breaks down into initialed and un-initialed
verses from the beginning of the Quran. We refer to all of the verses in the
initialed suras as initialed verses and all of the verses in the un-initialed suras

as un-initialed verses. Therefore, the sum of the verses in the un-initialed suras

60
up to sura 19 is;
7+ 176+ 120+ 165+ 75+ 127+ 128+ 111+ 110 = 1019. (4.48)

From table 4.10, we note that 10” initialed sura is number 19. If we do the

same exercise on the initialed verses we get;
286 + 200 + 206 + 109 + 123 + 111 + 43 + 52 + 99 + 98 = 1327. (4.49)

Again, from Table 4.10, note that the 13” initialed sura is number 27. These
numbers are fixing the position of suras 19 and 27 (note, sura 27 is the only
sura with two opening statements or Bismallah’s) and relating them to the
number of initialed and un-initialed verses up to sura 19 which is the base of
the Quranic mathematical code. Note that these numbers also generate 127

verses for chapter or sura 9.

4.20 Ultimate Mathematics: More Structure

Sura 42 is the only sura in the Quran with two sets of initials. The second
verse contains 3 initials us, pronounced Ayn-Seen-Qaaf, and there are 209
frequencies of & + 4» + Gin this sura which is 19 x 11. Counting all the verses
in this sura where all three letters are utilized, we found that there are 19 such
verses. Readers who are familiar with the Arabic language can easily verify this
property of the Quran for themselves. The first 8 verse numbers where all three
initials are mentioned add up to 98 and the total number of such verses is 19.
Remember that sura 19 has 98 verses and the 8” prime is number 19 and that
there are 8 mentions of the word «ill (Allah) or God in sura 19. Furthermore,
sura 98 has 8 verses. Also note that the letter (3 (Qaaf), sequentially, is the

19%" Arabic letter[4].

61
4.21 God’s Most Beautiful Names_ are
Mathematically Coded

God’s most beautiful names are mathematically coded in the Quran,
sequentially beyond our capabilities. This mathematics insures that the
combinations of God’s most beautiful names in certain verses in the Quran
are mathematically controlled. For example, we see throughout the Quran
in some verses God refers to Himself as el on pli *The Almighty, The All
Wise”. This mathematics tells us that in these verses, we could not have, for
instance, ”The Almighty, The All Merciful”, because this combination belongs
to other verses. Let us look at some examples. The 19°” word ” All Merciful” is
mentioned in 4:23, which refers to the 513" frequency of the word God. Note
that 513 = 19 x 27. The 83” frequency of the word ” All Merciful” occurs in
30:5. This is the only time that this word is mentioned in chapter 30. We
already know the relation between 83 and 30, note 83 is the 23" prime number
and the 23"? number in the Quran is 30. Furthermore the 83"? composite is 114
(the number of chapters in the Quran). Note that 83 is the 19*” relative prime
of 30 which is the 19*" composite and 83 + 30 = 113 which is the 30” prime

number.

4.22 Ultimate Mathematics

Note the following awesome mathematical relations in the Quran are based on
the Ultimate Mathematics, which we have been discussing, exclusively, here in
this book. We count the number of verses between 9 and 13, inclusively, and

make table 4.11. Note that the missing opening statement, i.e., Bismallah of

sura 9 has been compensated for in sura 27, verse 30. It happens that the 13!”
initialed sura is chapter 27 [4].

Columns 1 and 2 are chapters and their corresponding number of verses.
Column 3 is the prime/composite indices of column 2. Column 4 is the sum
of digits of column 1 and column 5 is the sum of digits of column 2. The 1%
three numbers in column 3 correspond to chapters 9, 10 and 11 (11 is the 19¢”
number in the Quran) and; 31 + 29+ 92 = 152 = 8 x 19. From 9 to 13 there
are 5 suras and 513 = 27 x 19. Chapter 27 is the 13°” initialed chapter and
is initialized with jb, pronounced TaSeen; the gematrical value of 4 (Ta) is
9, and its frequency in sura 27 is also 27. It provides another connection to
chapter 9. The indices in column 3 are corresponding to prime verses in column
2; 31+ 29+ 14 = 74 (sura 74 is where the number 19 is mentioned), and their
number of verses; 127+ 109+ 43 = 279, a concatenation of 27 and 9. All indices
add up to 247 = 13x 19. 36 is the 19*” initialed sura. The count of their initials
are 798 and 285 respectively, and 798 — 285 = 513 = 27x 19. Verse 13 of chapter
9 is the 9¢” verse in which God has been mentioned, and it is also the 13!” word

God from the beginning of this chapter. The 1%¢ number 9 in chapter 27 is

63
mentioned in verse 12, and 912 = 48 x 19. This pins down the location of the
other number 9 in verse 48, which is symmetrically placed around 27:30. The
sum of verses from chapter 11 to chapter 19 is 875; (sura 8 has 75 verses) and
the 875!” word God is mentioned in verse 6:19. If we add up the sura numbers
from 9 to 13, we get: 9+ 10+ 11+12+413 = 55. We know from table 4.11
that the sum of the digits in these numbers adds up to 19. The number 5519
happens to be the index of composite 6346, which is the total number of verses
in the Quran.

Although to God belongs the most beautiful names (Quran 7:180), in the
very first verse of the Quran, God has been introduced as Pad sl aad
meaning The All Gracious, The All Merciful. We see the mentions of these
attributes of God are positioned throughout the Quran according to the
mathematics described in chapter two. We noted before that God’s most
beautiful names or attributes do also conform with the sophisticated Quranic
mathematics. The words, gel (The All Gracious) and 625 (All Merciful) or
a al (The All Merciful) have been mentioned in the Quran 57 and 114 times,
respectively. Note that Pa al (The All Merciful) has been mentioned 34 times
and Pe j (All Merciful) is mentioned 80 times. The last frequency of the word
eal (The All Gracious) is in sura 78, verse 38 and the last frequency of the
word Pd 5 (All Merciful) is in sura 73 verse, 20. If we add these chapter numbers
and verse numbers, we get; 78 + 38 + 73 + 20 = 209 and 209 = 11 x 19. Note
that 11 here is not by accident. It happens that the 19!” number in the Quran
is number 11 which has been mentioned only once in the Quran in chapter 12,

verse 4, in association with 11 planets and Joseph’s dream. It is interesting if

64
we look at the frequency of the word a al, (The All Merciful), we find that
the last such mention of this word occurs in sura 59 verse 22. If we add these
numbers to 78:38 where the last occurrence of the word ”The All Gracious”
occurs, we obtain: 78 + 38 +59 +22 = 197. The number 197 is the 45” prime
number but more importantly, it is the sum of a very interesting composite and
its index. That composite happens to be 114, the number of chapters in the

Quran. We then have: 114 + 83 = 197.

4.23 The All Merciful, eo3}

As I mentioned in the previous section, the frequency of every word in the
Quran is mathematically designed. This design, controls every aspect of the
Quran and ensures its eternal aspect. There are 34 mentions of the word oa ll
(The All Merciful) in the Quran. The 83"¢ 65 (All Merciful) or eo (The All
Merciful) counted as though they were the same, occurs in chapter 30. Now, we
examine the frequency of Pa al (The All Merciful) up to chapter 30. Remember
that 30 is the 19*" composite. If we do this, we find that the 24‘ eo (The
All Merciful), occurs in chapter 30, verse 5. In this verse, we also find the 1906”
frequency of the word God. If we add the numbers for the frequencies of the
word God and the word oil (The All Merciful) we get: 1906 + 24 = 1930.
Note that the 19" composite is number 30 and a ai (The All Merciful) has
been mentioned only once in sura 30.

65
4.24 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Sura 9
Having 127 Verses

Ultimate Mathematics declares again as in so many ways that sura 9 has only 127
verses. If we look at the number of verses from sura 9, where the missing opening
statement occurs to the end of sura 27, where the missing opening statement is
compensated for, we have the following numbers; 127+109+123+111+443+52+
99+ 128+ 111+4+110+98+ 135+ 112+ 78+118+64+77 + 227+93 = 2015. Note
here that 2015 is a composite number and its index is 1709. Remember that
1709 is the total gematrical value of all of the initials in the Quran. Furthermore,
the Quran narrates explicitly God’s conversation with Moses;

20:15 - The Hour is surely coming, I keep it almost hidden, for each soul

must be paid for its work.
4.25 Relation between 19 and 68

The last initialed sura in the Quran is sura 68. If we add up all the sura
numbers up to and including sura 68 we get 2346. This is called the ” arithmetic
progression” from 1 to 68. I show how one can calculate it for any number.
Assume the number for which you wish to calculate the arithmetic series is N,

then the sum of all the numbers from 1 to N is;

sa Nxt) (4.50)
2
For example for N = 68, we have;
68 68 +1
S= ee = 2346. (4.51)

We also know that the sum of the verses from chapter | to 19 is 2346. The

66
index of composite 2346 is 1998 and sura 19 has 98 verses [5]. Note here again
that the number of numbered verses up to and including chapter 19 signifies 68

as a special sum, which we know as being the last initialed sura.

4.26 The Faith

The Quran emphasizes that the only religion acceptable to God is submission.
It also tells us that submission is the religion of Abraham, father of all those
who submit to God, and God was the one who called us submitters originally.
This information is contained in the last verse of sura 22 or 22:78. The number
2278 happens to be the arithmetic progression of 67 which is the 19" prime

number.

14+2+3+4+4+5....4+17....+67 = 2278. (4.52)
Or as we note from the above equation;

S = 67 x > = 2278. (4.53)

It is interesting that the word cy wl or °The Faith” is mentioned in this verse in
the context that God has not put any burden on us in practicing our faith. This
word oy wi or the faith happens to be the 19” frequency of this word from the
beginning of the Quran. Now we have seen that everything in the Quran has
been designed and intricately put together. The reader can verify this Quranic

fact from any of the published concordances of the Quran.

4.27 The Unfaithful, 95 361

The Quran tells us in sura 74 verse 30 that, “Over it is 19”. It gives us 5

reasons as to why the number 19 was chosen. The fifth or the last reason given

67
is to expose the people who harbor doubt and ”The Unfaithful”, for they say;
* what did God mean by this allegory?” (Quran, 74:31). There are several ways
one can make Arabic nouns plural. For example, the word ”The Unfaithful”
can be either (4 F<) ”Al-Kaferoon” or cy sl ” Al-Kafereen”. We know that
every word in the Quran is mathematically composed in order to prove to us
that the Quran is the unaltered word of our Creator. It happens that the word
” Al-Kaferoon” used here in conjunction with the 19-based mathematical code
of the Quran is the 19" such word from the beginning of the Quran. The reader

can verify this from any of the published concordances of the Quran.

4.28 Ultimate Mathematics

Every word in the Quran is numbered and according to the Quran, God has
counted the number of all things and has assigned a number to everything. The
Quran informs us that the Sun and Moon are perfectly calculated. Remember
that the Quran’s mathematical structure is based on the number 19. If we count
the number of the word “pall, pronounced ” Al-Qamar” or ”The Moon” from the
beginning of the Quran we find the 19" such word in 54:1. In 54:2 God tells
us about the 19-based mathematical code of the Quran and how people ignored
it and called it old magic. Verse 54:1 is connected to 74:30 where we find the
number 19 explicitly mentioned. Note that number 541 is a prime number and
it happens to be the 100" prime number. Number 100 happens to be the
74'" composite (non-prime) number and it is the 30°" number mentioned in the
Quran. Therefore, God mathematically guides us to the 74:30 and the number
19. Note that 30 is the 19” composite.

68
In 74:31 the Quran tells us why the number 19 was assigned by God. The
last reason is given to expose the doubters and the unfaithful. Again the word
Os Ai pronounced ” Al Kaferoon” meaning ”the unfaithful” mentioned in this
verse is the 19" such word from the beginning of the Quran. In 74:32 God takes
an oath by ”The Moon”. If you read sura 54, it keeps repeating that God has
made the Quran easy to learn, does any one wish to learn? The 19*” frequency
of the word res, pronounced ”AShams” meaning ”The Sun” coincides with
the 11” frequency of the word pal or ”The Moon” in 29:61. Remember that
11 is the 19°” number mentioned in the Quran. The number 11 mentioned in
sura 12 verse 4, is in conjunction with Joseph’s dream and the eleven planets.

When we look at all the verses where the words pall ) nel, meaning "the
Sun and the Moon”, are mentioned together we find 18 such verses. These
verses are tabulated in table 4.12.

Note that although there are only 18 verses, there are 19 frequencies of eal
4 neal. Note from the above paragraph that the 19” frequency of the Sun
and the 11*” frequency of the Moon are in 29:61. From table 4.12, we see that
the 10°” frequency of the Sun and the Moon mentioned together, is in 29:61.
Note that the 10” prime is 29 and 61 is the 18"” prime, hence the 18 verses in
table 4.12. Note that in verse 6:96, where the first *the Sun and the Moon” is
mentioned, the Quran tells us that these heavenly bodies are calculation devices
and the last mention in 75:9 is when the cosmos expires and the Sun and the

Moon expire.

4.29 54:1 Ultimate Mathematics, Continued

We note the following properties of 2961 and its relation to key Quranic numbers

such as 9127.

e Number 1911*" ”Positionally Partitionable” number is 1931 and 29:61 is

the 1931°* initialed verse.

e In the 9 verses where *the sun” is mentioned by itself (up to 29:61), the
sura numbers add up to 151 and the verse numbers add up to 806. Note
that 806 = 13 x 62. Furthermore, the 1362" numbered verse is 9:127 and
9127 is the 1131°¢ prime number, finally, the 1131* initialed verse is 15:1.

Therefore, we are back to 151, which is the sum of the sura numbers.

e *The sun” and *the moon” are mentioned together in 10 verses (up to
and including 29:61). The 10” initialed sura is sura 19, which has 798
initials, and the 798*” Positionally Partitionable number is 806. Note the

sum of the verse numbers from the first item.

e When we add up all the sura and verse numbers where “the sun” and
*the moon” have been mentioned up to 29:61, we get 1508, which is the
1490” Positionally Partitionable number and the 1490” numbered verse

is 11:19. [5]

4.30 <A Criterion

In verse 39:45 of the Quran, the Quran has provided a litmus test in order to
expose people who do not believe in the hereafter. Verse 39:45 tells us that

the hearts of this group shrink with aversion when God alone is mentioned, but

71
when others are mentioned besides Him, they rejoice. Every new mathematical
fact in the Quran carries with it great responsibility and forces us to pay more
attention to its content. If we count all the verses in sura 39 where the word
God has been mentioned only once, we find that verse 39:45 is the 19” such
verse. We can verify quickly that sura 39 is the 19” un-initialed sura and the
45‘ wn-initialed sura is chapter 74 and that 74 is the chapter where the number

19 has been mentioned [4].
4.31 Ultimate Mathematics, Continued

The count of verses where the word God has been mentioned only once, plays
an important role in the second sura. The 19” such verse is number 67 and 67
is the 19” prime. Note that 2 is the first prime and 2:67 is a concatenation of
the first prime and the 19” prime. The 267!” prime happens to be 1709 which
coincides with the gematrical values of the Quranic initials. The 23"¢ such verse
is verse 74. Remember that the 74°” sura revealed is sura 23. The 23'¢ number

in the Quran is number 30 and 74:30 is where the number 19 is mentioned.

e The 267'" prime is 1709, their sum is 1976, and the 1976'” ” Positionally
Partitionable” number is 1998. The 1998" composite is 2346, and 19:98
is the 2346" numbered verse, 2346 is the 2321* Positionally Partitionable
number, 2321 is the 1976" composite, 1976 is the 1677" composite, and

16:77 is the 1976" numbered verse.

e 2:67 is the 74” numbered verse, and 267 + 74 = 341, 2:67 is the 67%"
numbered verse in sura 2, and 267 + 67 = 334, and 3:41 is the 334!”

numbered verse, and 19 x 334 = 6346, which is the total number of verses

72
in the Quran.

e The sura numbers and the verse numbers of these 19 verses add up to 638,
6:38 is the 341° un-initialed numbered verse, and God says that ” We did
not leave anything out of this book.” Note that 341 = 11 x 31 and the

1131 prime is 9127.

e When we add the sura and the verse numbers where God is mentioned
twice in the verse, they add up to 821, which is the index of composite 988
(sura 98 called Al-Bayeenah or ” the proof” has 8 verses), 988 +821 = 1809
and the 1809*” numbered verse is 15:9, which says that God will ” protect”

the Quran.

¢ 821 is the 142” prime, 821 — 142 = 679, and 679 x 19 = 12901. When
we add up the numbers of all 114 suras in the Quran and the number of

verses in each of these suras, we get 12901, which is 679 x 19.{5]

4.32 Ultimate Mathematics: Awesome
Mathematical Relation

Quran with its amazing expanse of mathematical code glorifies and magnifies
its Author, The Almighty, who speaks to us through a mathematics beyond our
capability, yet simple to understand. Again, we must remember, according to
72:28, God has counted the number of all things or has assigned a number to
everything. The mathematical proofs we are about to learn are in conjunction
with sura 42, the only sura in the Quran with two sets of initials. Shown in
table 4.13 are the sums of id te (H’s + M’s) in the seven oe (H.M.)-initialed
suras.

73
Table 4.13: Frequency of the initials c (Ha) and e (Meem) in suras 40 through

42 353
43 368
44 166

46 261
Total 2147 = 19 x 113

Note that chapter 42 is the only chapter where the sum of eo (H’s + M’s
= 353) is a prime number. This prime is the 71%‘ prime number. Therefore, we
get the number 4271, which is simply a permutation of 2147. We already knew
these mathematical relations, however, what we did not know is the first verse
in sura 42 which is eo (H.M.) is the 4271 numbered verse from the beginning
of the Quran. Note that 4271 is a twin prime and it is the 114” twin prime,
which is the number of chapters in the Quran. Furthermore, 42 + 71 = 113
which is the coefficient of 19 for the sum total of the seven e (H.M.)-initialed
suras that is 2147 = 19 x 113. Because 4271 is a permutation of 2147, let us
look at the permutation group properties of the four digits 1, 2, 4 and 7. We
display these numbers in table 4.14.

Note there are seven prime numbers in table 4.14, referring to the seven
e>-initialed suras. There are two numbers in the table 4.14 that are divisible
by 19. These are 2147 and 4712; group elements number 7 and 17. Note that

17 is the 7°” prime. If we add these group elements, we get;

2147 + 4712 = 6859 = 19 x 19 x 19. (4.54)

4.33 Ultimate Mathematics: Another Awesome
Mathematical Relation

This mathematics is beyond our capability and yet simple to understand. Again,
the mathematical structure we are about to learn together are in conjunction
with sura 19, the only sura in the Quran with five (5) letters in its set of initials
ga (K.H.Y.A.S). Note again that the base of these Ultimate Mathematics
is the number 19 as it is described in the Quran. In table 4.15, the initialed
suras are shown up to and including sura 19 and their corresponding number of
numbered verses are also listed.

If we add all the numbered verses up to and including verse 19:1 we get
1230, which is the 42"¢ Twin Prime Companion (TPC). Remember, TPCs are
the composites sandwiched between a pair of twin primes. Note, the total
number of all initial letters in chapter 19, i.e. 3's + o's + gs + fs + ye’s (K’s
+ H’s + Y’s + A’s + S’s) utilized in sura 19 is 798 = 19 x 42. Note here, a

Sura 42 is the only sura in the Quran with two sets of initials. In previous
sections, we mentioned that the 4271°' numbered verse from the beginning of the
Quran, is the ce (H.M.) verse of chapter 42 which is the very first verse of this
sura. We also noted that the total frequency of all H’s and M’s utilized in sura
42 is 353 which is the 71*' prime and hence, 4271. This is a formidable proof by
itself, however proofs are multi-faceted. We know that 42 is related to 19, since
there are 798 = 42 x 19 total frequency of the initial letters yan (K.H.Y.A.S)
in sura 19. If we look at all the ”positionally partitionable numbers”, we find
that 4271 is the 4219" positionally partitionable number. This takes us back

to 42 and 19.

76
4.35 More Ultimate Mathematics

Chapter 40 is the first of the seven oe (H.M.)-initialed suras, and the only sura
in the Quran where the phrase 31> 9 wl, pronounced ” Allahu Wahdahu”,
meaning ”God alone” has been mentioned twice in 40:12 and 40:84. In 40:12,
the verse ends with the phrase that the ” Judgment is with God, The All High,
The Supreme”. In Arabic it is ~SUI ) AN) es. pronounced ” Falhukmu
Lellahe Al-Alee Al-Kabeer”. We see that this important verse is mathematically
positioned to control the total number of C (H’s) and ? (M’s) in all seven eo
initialed chapters which we know is 2147 = 19 x 113. If we count all the
numbered verses from the beginning of the Quran, we find that 40:12 is the
4143" numbered verse. We know that there are 8 mentions of the word ASI
(Al-Kabeer) in the entire Quran. It turns out that 4143 is 2147 written in base

8, or;
(2147)19 = (4143)s. (4.55)
These are controlling mechanisms put in place by the Ultimate Mathematics.

4.36 Awesomeness of the Mathematics

Sura 13 has a very unique position in the Quran. We know that the 13” integer
in the Quran is 19 and we study all the mathematical proofs associated with it
controlling the number of verses in sura 9. This sura is related to chapter 22 and
actually controlling the number of verses in that chapter. Remember that the
sum of frequencies of the initials HM (pronounced “alif, ”laam”,”meem”, ”raa” )
in chapter 13 is 1482 = 19 x 78, and that the 13" composite is 22 and sura 22

has 78 verses. If we count the number of verses from 13:1 to 22:43 (remember

77
that sura 13 has 43 verses) there are 931 = 19 x 49. Note chapter 49 is the 22”¢
un-initialed sura in the Quran. Furthermore, the 931° composite is 1119. Note
the 19” number (including fractions) in the Quran is 11, which is mentioned
in chapter 12, verse 4. Verse 11:19 is the 1343" frequency of the word God
signifying that sura 13 has 43 verses. Furthermore, as described above, sura 13
is related in a multi-dimensional way to sura 22 in the Quran. Note sura 13
is an initialed sura and the number of initials is 1482. This number is a ” twin
prime companion” (TPC) and it happens to be the 49'" TPC. Sura 49 is the

22"4 wn-initialed sura in the Quran.
4.37 More Ultimate Mathematics

Chapter 13 called *The Thunder” talks about how the thunder glorifies and
praises God and so do the Angels out of reverence for Him. Here we discuss the
number of verses, where the verse number is a prime number and the method
by which it connects sura 13 to 22. If we count the number of verses where
the verse number is a prime up to the end of sura 13 we find 419 such verses.
Number 419 happens to be the 22” twin prime. We find there is only one
chapter in the Quran, which has 13 verses and it is chapter 60. If we continue
counting the number of verses where the verse number is a prime up to the end
of chapter 60 (60:13), we find there are 1343 such verses. Note sura 13 has 43

verses.

4.38 Awesome Mathematical Proofs

Let the order of a verse be the number of times God is mentioned in that verse.
(e.g., verses of order 0, have 0 frequencies of the word God.) These proofs again

78
are in connection with chapter 9 and the number of its actual verses which is
127. Starting with verse 126 in sura 9, the last 0-ordered verse (a verse where
the word God is not mentioned) and counting backwards, we find that the 12th
such verse is verse 73; pointing to 1273, which is the frequency of the word God
until the end of chapter 9. Now we do the same exercise with the ordered verses
(the verses where the word God has been mentioned at least once) starting with
verse 127 in sura 9 and counting towards the beginning, we find the following
simple facts: the 36" such verse is 83, the 63% such verse is 46, and the 76'”
such verse is 31.

These are controlling parameters telling us that chapter 36 has 83 verses;
total number of verses in the entire Quran is 6346, and chapter 76 has 31

verses. [4]

4.39 Awesome Mathematical Fact

I have been explaining above specific details about sura 13 (the 13¢” integer in
the Quran is 19) in the Quran and all the mathematical facts associated with
it controlling the number of verses in sura 9. Sura 13 is related to chapter 27,
because the 13" initialed sura is 27. Remember that sura 27 is the only chapter
in the Quran where the opening statement of the Quran, i.e. Bismallah, which
is mentioned in the beginning of every chapter except for chapter 9; has been
mentioned twice, thereby compensating for the missing opening statement of
sura 9. The number of verses from the beginning of sura 9 to the end of sura
13 is 513 = 19 x 27. Shown in table 4.16 are the number of verses in chapters 9,

10, 11, 12, and 13. Some of these numbers are primes and some are composites.

The sum of numbers in the third column of table 4.16 is 133 = 7 x 19. Note
here that the coefficient of 19 is 7 and we further note that the 7” initialed sura

in the Quran is chapter 13.

4.40 Another Mathematical Fact

The following mathematical fact has to do with the sequence of the suras where
the number of verses is a prime in the Quran. In table 4.17, suras where the
number of verses are prime numbers are tabulated. In the first column, the
sequence of such suras is listed.

Note here again in table 4.17, the 19” sura in the Quran with a prime
number as its number of verses is 82 which happens to be the first chapter in
the Quran with 19 as its number of verses.

We also note there is one word God mentioned in sura 82 and it is the 19!”
frequency of the word God from the end of the Quran. Note also that this word
God is mentioned in verse 19 of this chapter [4].

4.41 Awesome Mathematical Fact: Sura 9 has
127 Verses

The Quran has many features by which it mathematically dictates how many
verses each chapter must have. We know that, for example, chapter 9 is of special
interest because two verses 128 and 129 have always been suspect. However,
every sura in the Quran is mathematically guarded to contain specific number
of verses and nothing else but those specific numbers. The proof, I am about
to introduce to you, is about the positions of initialed suras or chapters in the
Quran. There are many ways to connect chapter 9, 13, 22, and 27. We further
note relations among 9, 13, 19 and 22 and how the number of verses in 9 is
controlled by the position of initialed suras in the Quran. The reader should
note that 22 is the 13” composite and if we tabulate all the initialed suras in

24 such chapter. It is very easy for

the Quran, we note that chapter 41 is the 2
the reader to verify that the 13” prime number is 41 and that the 13°” integer
in the Quran, in ascending magnitude is 19. If we count all the numbered verses
from 9:127 to 22:41 we find that there are 1273 verses. Note that 1273 = 19 x 67,
where 67 is the 19" prime, but more important is that 1273 is the number of
frequency of the word wl (Allah) or God from the beginning of the Quran to
the end of chapter 9, or verse 127. As I have been stressing, the importance of
verse 17:88 becomes clear, which states:

17:88 - Say; "If all the humans and the jinns band together to produce a
Quran like this, they could never produce one like it, no matter how much

assistance they lend one another.”

82
4.42 Awesome Mathematical Fact: Lonely
Primes Control Number of Verses

The number of verses in each and every sura in the Quran must be exactly what
they are and nothing else. Let us look at sura 13 and 31. We note immediately
that 31 is the reverse of 13. We find that chapter 13 has 43 verses and that
chapter 31 has 34 verses. We note that 43 is also the reverse of 34. These are
simple observations that one can readily make. Now if we look at the position
of un-initialed suras in the Quran, we note that the 13” un-initialed sura is
chapter 24 and the 31° un-initialed sura is 59. If we look at sura 59, we note
that it has 24 verses. Now, if we count all the verses from 13:1 to 59:24, we
see that there are 3443 verses. Note from the above that 13 has 43 verses and
31 has 34 verses. If we count the number of verses from 13:1 to 24:59, we note
that there are 1143 verses and 1143 = 9 x 127. We know that chapter 9 has
127 verses. Furthermore, 1143 is the index of composite 1362. Verse 9:127 is
the 1362” numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran. Now this is also
connected to chapter 19. We note that the 13” integer in the Quran is 19
and 191 (191 referring to 19:1) is the 43™¢ prime number and chapter 13 has
43 verses. We also can verify that the 191° lonely prime is 2137, which is the

322"¢ prime and if we add it to its index we get;
2137 + 322 = 2459. (4.56)

The number 2459 is another lonely prime and it happens to the 221% such
prime. These numbers directly connect verses 19:1 to 22:1. As described in
chapter two, lonely primes are the primes left of the integers when we remove
all twin primes from the set of primes. Therefore, the first lonely prime is 2,

83
the second is 23 and the third is 37 and so on.

4.43. Awesome Mathematical Facts

Every chapter in the Quran must have the number of verses as is forced by the
Ultimate Mathematics. Let us look at chapter 43 and chapter 24. We see that
chapter 43 is the 24*” initialed sura and the 24” prime is 89 and we know that
chapter 43 has 89 verses. Chapter 52 is the 24” un-initialed sura in the Quran.
Number 24 is the 14" composite and chapter 14 has 52 verses. Chapter 52 is
the 24” un-initialed sura and 24 is the 13" un-initialed sura. Chapter 49 is the
22"4 wn-initialed sura and 22 is the 13°" composite. Note, sura 52 has 49 verses.
These simple but fundamental loops control the number of verses in different

suras in the Quran.

4.44 Awesome Mathematical Facts

Ve note the following awesome mathematical fact, further proving that the total
number of oe initials in chapters 40 through 46 must be 2147. The key again is
chapter 42, the only sura or chapter in the Quran where the first two verses are
composed of initials. In this sura, if we count the verses where the word God is
mentioned, we find that the 21° such occurrence is verse number 47, therefore
we are back to 2147. We also look at chapter 47, and we find that there are 21

verses where the word God is mentioned. We are again back to 2147 [4].

84
4.45 Number of Initials in Sura 13 Confirms
that Sura 9 has 127 Verses

The mathematical fact, I am about to introduce to you, is about the positions
of verses in certain initialed suras or chapters in the Quran and how these are
connected to the frequency of initials and number of verses in different suras.
I have shown you many mathematical links between chapters 9 and 13. This
time, we note further relations between chapters 9 and 13 and how the number
of verses in sura 9 is controlled by the position of certain verses in initialed suras
in the Quran. The reader should remember that sura 13 is an initialed sura and
its initials are composed of four different Arabic letters, M (A.L.M.R.). The

total frequency of all these letters in chapter 13 is 1482. If we look at the 1482”¢

numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran, we find that it is the 11!”

verse
of chapter 11. Now let us look only at the total number of verses in the initialed
suras up to and including 11:11. We find that 11:11 is the 812*" such verse. On
the other hand, if we count all of the numbered verses in the un-initialed suras
up to the end of chapter 9 we note that there are 670 such verses. Obviously,
if one adds 670 and 812 one obtains 1482, however, the intricacy of the Quran
is revealed when we note that 812 is a composite number and it happens to
be the 670" composite. In other words, 1482 is partitionable into a composite
and its index. Note that if you count all the verses including the un-numbered
opening statements, i.e., Bismallah’s, in the initialed suras up to and including
11:11, one finds that there are 817 such verses. Note that 817 = 19 x 43 and
that chapter 13 has 43 verses. I remind the reader that 11:11 is the 1482"¢

numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran and this is the number of the

85
frequency of the usage of the initials in chapter 13. This design is only possible
by God and no one else. It is befitting to stress the importance of verse 17:88,
which states:

17:88 - Say, "If all the humans and the jinns band together to produce a
Quran like this, they could never produce one like it, no matter how much

assistance they lend one another.”

4.46 Awesome Mathematical Fact: Primes and
Number of oa and Number of Verses are
Controlled

We note the following property in sura 42. Sura 42 is the only sura in the Quran
where the first two numbered verses are composed entirely of initials. This fact
is connected to the first set of initials, namely, (HaMeem) and where the two
letters c (H) and e (M) are utilized in verses with a prime number as the verse
number. As mentioned above, the reader should keep in mind that verse 42:2
is also composed entirely of initials Gus (A.S.Q.). When we count all the cs
(H’s) and ’’s (M’s) up to the end of verse 13, we find that the total frequency
of usage of H’s + M’s in verses with primes as their number is 43. Note that
sura 13 has 43 verses. If we continue counting until the end of the 13” prime
which is verse 41, we find that there are 78 usages of H’s + M’s in the prime
numbered verses. Note that 41 is the 22"¢ initialed sura and we know that sura
22 has 78 verses. The reader should note that sura 13 has 19 x 78 A’s + L’s
+ M’s + R’s used in the entire sura. If we keep counting the number of usage
of H’s and M’s in prime-numbered verses, the next one is verse 43 which is the
14” prime and we note that the number of H’s + M’s up to and including verse

86
43 is 82. Therefore, we are back to 1482 and we know that this is the number of
frequency of usage of the initials A’s + L’s + M’s + R’s in chapter 13 and that
this chapter has 43 verses. If we keep counting until the end of this chapter, we
find that there are 15 verses with primes as their verse number, the number of
frequency of usage of H’s + M’s is 99. One can easily verify that sura 15 has 99

verses. [4]

4.47 Awesome Mathematical Fact: Number of
Initials in Sura 43

The mathematical facts, I am introducing to you, is about the frequency of
occurrence of c and e (H’s and M’s) in the oe (H.M.)-initialed chapter 43. We
focus on the verses with a prime number assigned to them and contain both
usages of the Arabic letters c (H) and ? (M). We find that there are 11 such
verses. Now what immediately comes to mind is that the number 1143 = 9x 127.
The total sum of the frequency of c te (H’s + M’s) up to and including verse
89 is 59. Note that 89 is the 24” prime number and chapter 59 in the Quran
is the only chapter which contains 24 verses. It is noteworthy that 43 is the
24 initialed sura and the first verse in this chapter happens to be the 4324!"
numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran. Now if we subtract 4324 from
8959, we get 4635. Note that chapter 46, the last oe (H.M.)-initialed sura, has

35 verses.

87
4.48 Number of Verses Are Controlled by the
Positions of Suras

A sophisticated, yet simple, mathematical connection controls the number of
verses in suras in the Quran to their position in the domain of initialed or un-
initialed chapters and their indices in the prime and composite universe. I bring
you a few examples, by which we see these awesome mathematical relations.
These examples are easy to verify and can be checked very easily. The 13th
un-initialed sura is 24, the 24*” initialed sura is 43 and sura 43 has 89 verses.
So we have, 13, 24, 43, 89.

Note 13 has 43 verses and the 24" prime number is 89. If we add this
prime to its index we get 24+ 89 = 113. Number 113 is the 30” prime and
sura 89 has 30 verses. Note also that, 43 + 24 = 67 and 43 — 24 = 19. We
know that 67 is the 19‘” prime. Note also that sura 67 has 30 verses and 30
is the 19” composite. Chapter 43 is the only chapter in the Quran with such
a mathematical property. Sura 78 is the 49” un-initialed sura in the Quran.

Sura 49 is the 22”¢ un-initialed sura. Sura 22 has 78 verses.

4.49 Awesome Mathematics: Chapter 9 has 127
Verses

By now, we know that sura or chapter 9 in the Quran has 127 verses. We have
also learned, that not only the chapter 9 has to have 127 verses, but that every
sura or chapter in the Quran must have a specific number of verses. Now, here
are more mathematical facts as to why 9 has to have 127 verses. Let us recap
some of the many mathematical facts why sura 9 must have 127 verses. We

know that verse 9:127 is the 1362"¢ verse from the beginning of the Quran and

88
that 1362 is the 1143" composite and we have; [5]

1143 = 9 x 127. (4.57)

Note that sura 9 is an un-initialed sura and 9:127 happens to be the 670""
un-initialed verse from the beginning of the Quran. If we subtract this number
from 1362 which is the total number verses up to and including 9:127 we get 692
which is the number of initialed verses, as we would expect. But, if we subtract

670 from 1143 which is the index of 1362:
1143 — 670 = 473 (4.58)
and we find that;
473 = 11 x 43. (4.59)

Furthermore, verse 11:43 in the Quran is the 1514‘” numbered verse from
the beginning of the Quran. Obviously, because 1514 is an even number, it is a
composite and it happens to be the 1273" composite. The reader should note

that the 1273" frequency of the word a (Allah) or God occurs in 9:127.

4.50 More Mathematical Facts

So far, I have been showing the reader that it is not only the literal sense of the
Quran, or its mathematical composition which can not be imitated, but that
the mathematics that generated the Quran is beyond our capability. Let me
give you another example besides the many examples given before. The number
of verses from the beginning of the Quran to 19:98 which is the end of sura 19 is
2346 and 1998 is the index of 2346. If we count the number of verses from 9:1 to

89
19:98 we find that there are 1111 verses and if we do the same exercise and count
the number of verses from 9:1 to 23:46, we find that there are 1482 verses. The
intricacy of the mathematics becomes evident when we note that verse 11:11 is
the 1482"¢ verse from the beginning of the Quran. We also learned, if we look
at the initialed verses up to and including 11:11, we find that this verse is the
812*" such verse. This number is a composite and its index is 670. We also
note that the 670" un-initialed verse from the beginning of the Quran is 9:127.
Therefore, 1482 is partitionable into a composite and its index such that the
index is referring to sura 9 having 127 verses. Note that 1482 is the number of

frequency of the initials in sura 13.

4.50.1 Primes and Lonely Primes and Number Base
System Produce the Quran

96:1 - Read in the name of your Lord who created.

The above verse, namely 96:1, was the very first verse ever revealed. Sura 96,
therefore, constitutes the very first sura in the chronological order of revelation
of the Quran. We know today, that the Quran is mathematically generated
beyond our capability. In sura 74 verse 30, the Quran tells us; ” Over it is 19”.
Accordingly, this first revelation contains 19 verses. Now, let us look at the
awesome mathematical properties of the number 9619 and how this number
controls the number of suras or chapters in the Quran by the manifestation of
the Ultimate Mathematics.

Number 9619 is a prime number and its index is 1187. In other words, the
1187‘ prime number is 9619. Number 1187 is also a prime number, however, it
is a special prime, called a “lonely” prime. We introduced the lonely primes in

90
chapter two of this book, as a part of the Ultimate Mathematics of the Quran. I
will refresh the reader’s memory by saying that a lonely prime is obtained once
the twin primes are removed from the set of the prime numbers. Therefore, the
first ten (10) lonely primes are 2, 23, 37, 47, 53, 67, 79, 83, 89, and 97. Now, if
we look at the index of the lonely prime 1187, we note that it is the 114‘” lonely
prime. Note that 114 is the number of suras or chapters in the Quran. I want
to stress that these mathematical relations are not known to mathematicians.
This mathematics is beyond the capability of humans and jinns together, no
matter how much assistance they give to one another, as it is stated by God
in 17:88. These are manifestations of the Ultimate Mathematics, described in

chapter two, as it shaped a scripture called the Quran.

4.51 Ultimate Mathematics: Awesomeness
Pure Mathematical Facts

The basic message of the Quran is that there is no god but God. As mentioned
previously, the Quran is a unique book, having a property never seen in any
other literary work, with 29 chapters starting with letters that do not make up
any Arabic word, as the first verse and in one case also as the second verse. These
chapters are referred to as the “initialed” suras|3]. These letters constitute a
mathematical code and they are part of the proof of the Quran’s eternal aspect.
The revelation of the Quran chronologically was not the same as its compiled
version. For example, the first sura revealed was 96 and the last sura was 110.
Sura 96 has 19 verses and the number 9619 generates parameters of the Quran
in a way that is truly amazing. The number 9619 is a prime number and its

index is 1187. Number 1187 is also a prime and, as mentioned above, belongs

91
to a group of unique primes that we have called “lonely” primes. Now if look
at the index of 1187 in the domain of lonely primes, we note that it is the 114”
such prime. The reader notes that 114 is the number of chapters in the Quran.
Prime 9619 is also a lonely prime and it happens to be the 790!” lonely prime.
At first glance, the number 790 does not tell us anything pertaining to any of
the parameters of the Quran, however, it would, if we look at it in a different
light. If we assume that 790 is written in base 19 and we were to convert it into

base 10, then we have;
7x 197 +9 x 19+0 = 2698. (4.60)

It can be easily verified that the number 2698 is the frequency of the word
wi (Allah) or God in the Quran. Just imagine a book that tells its reader, in
such a unique and humanly impossible way, how many chapters it has and how

many times the name of its author has been mentioned in it.

4.52 Ultimate Mathematics: Awesomeness of
the Quran

I must say, that there is no end to this structure. Let me now explain the
following mathematical fact. Sura 27 in the Quran, called *The Ant”, is an
initialed sura. It happens to be the 13” initialed sura in the Quran. Sura 13 is
also an initialed sura and the sum of the total frequency of the four initials in
this chapter is 1482. The number 1482 is a TPC and it is the 49*” such number
and 1482 is also equal to 19 x 78. Note that the 49” un-initialed sura is sura
78. The number 1482 written in base 19 is 420 and 420 happens to be another

TPC and it is the 22"¢ such number. Note that the 22”¢ un-initialed sura in the

Quran is 49 and chapter 22 has 78 verses. Note also that the 2249" numbered

verse from the beginning of the Quran is 19:1. Also 22 is the 13”

composite and
22 written in base 19 is 13 and the 13*” integer in the Quran is 19. Verse 4:20 is

the 513" numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran and 513 = 19 x 27.

Note that the 13*” initialed sura is 27.

4.53 Ultimate Mathematics: Awesome
Mathematical Facts

In this section, I introduce you to a mathematical fact which explains one of the
many reasons, why Arabic was chosen as the language of the Quran, and how
this confirms the number of verses in three suras of the Quran and emphasizes
that since Muhammad was the recipient of the Quran, then sura 9 has to have
127 verses.

Let us look at suras 43 through 46. Remember that seven suras in the Quran,
namely 40 through 46 are initialed with the two Arabic letters c (Ha) and ?
(Meem). Table 4.18 shows the frequency of these letters from sura 43 to sura
46. Note that the sequence of oe (Ha) and (Meem) is from right to left as in
the Arabic text. The reason for this will become apparent as we proceed.

93
From table 4.18, we note that the sum of ?s (M’s)is 899 and the sum of cs
(H’s) is 127. If we put number 43, the sura number we started with, in front of
899 127, we get 43899127. This number tells us that sura 43 has 89 verses and

sura 9 has 127 verses. If we perform the following operation;

9127 — 4389 = 4738. (4.61)
Note also that 4738 tells us that sura 47 has 38 verses. Furthermore,

4738 = 23 x 2 x 103. (4.62)

The indices of these prime factors are 9, 1 and 27. We, therefore, are back to
sura 9 having 127 verses. Also, please note that sura 47 is called Muhammad.
Therefore, sura 47 by having 38 verses is telling us that the Quran which was
revealed to Muhammad had 127 verses in sura 9. Remember, the order of
writing prime factors in the above equation is based on the fact that 9127 is the

19'” permutation of 1279 and the order is forced by verse 74:30, ” Over it is 19”.

4.54 Ultimate Mathematics: Over it is 19

17:88 - Say; ”If all the humans and the jinns band together to produce a Quran
like this, they could never produce one like it, no matter how much assistance
they lend one another.”

In this section, I will introduce you to a mathematical fact which generates
many parameters of the Quran. Let us look at chapter 19 and count all the
numbered verses until the end of this chapter or sura, namely from 1:1 to 19:98.

We find that there are 2346 such verses. The number 2346 is a composite and

94
Table 4.19: Permutation group elements of 2346 with their ascending positional
indices

12 3642 24 6432

it is the 1998" composite and we note that the last verse in sura 19 is 98 [5].
This should be enough to bring clear evidence of the uniqueness of the Quran
as a literary piece of work. This is only part of the story. Let us look at all the
permutation group elements of 2346 in ascending order. Table 4.19 illustrates
this facet of the Ultimate Mathematics in the best manner.

We plainly see that the 19” index corresponds to group element 6234. The
number, 6234, is the total number of *numbered verses” in the entire Quran.
This is why, in 74:30, God says ” Over it is 19”. Note, this is only possible if and
only if sura 9 has 127 verses. Remember, we started with 2346 and obtained

the number of verses in the entire Quran. Let us do the following operation.

6234 — 2346 = 3888. (4.63)

Note, sura 38 has 88 verses.

Chapter or sura 44 in the Quran is one of the seven eo (H.M.)-initialed chapters
in the Quran. We shall see here that the frequency of the usage of the Arabic
letters id and e (H and M) and their sum actually links these Arabic letters to
the number of chapters in the Quran, the number of initialed suras in the Quran
and the number of verses in sura 9.

Let us look at table 4.20.

A simple look at the numbers in table 4.20 reveals that all are even and
therefore all are composites. A simple operation of composite-index relation
will reveal astonishing information regarding the Quran. Let us look at table
4.21.

Numbers in table 4.21 tell us that there are 29 initialed suras in the Quran,
and that the Quran has 114 suras and that sura 9 has 127 verses.

4.56 Ultimate Mathematics: Over it is 19

17:88 - Say; ”If all the humans and the jinns band together to produce a Quran
like this, they could never produce one like it, no matter how much assistance
they lend one another.”

Let us look at chapter 11 and 13 and the frequency of the number of initials
in these two suras. We have 2489 | + J+ 5, A’s + L’s + R’s utilized in chapter
11 and 1482 | + J+ ptoor A’s + L’s + M’s + R’s utilized in chapter 13. There
are awesome relations between these numbers and the number of verses and the
position of the word al (Allah) or God in the Quran which are independent of
language. Let us look at all the permutation group elements of 1482 in ascending
order. Table 4.22 illustrates this manifestation of the Ultimate Mathematics in
the best possible way.

We see that the 19” index corresponds to the group element 8124. Now, let

us count all the verses from 1:1 to 81:24; there are 5822 numbered verses. One

97
notes that sura 58 has 22 verses. Furthermore, the last frequency of the word ai
(Allah) or God in 58:22 is 2489. Note that 2489 is the frequency of 1s+ (s+ ys
(A’s + L’s + R’s) in sura 11. Remember, we started with 1482 and obtained
the number of verses in sura 58 and connected this to the frequency of initials in
sura 11. Verse 11:11 in the Quran is the 1482”¢ verse from the beginning of the
Quran and from 58:22 to the end of the Quran there are exactly 1111 verses.
Verse 11:11 is the 812" initialed verse from the beginning of the Quran
and 812 is the 670" composite. The sum of 670 + 812 = 1482 and 11:11, as
mentioned above is the 1482"% verse from the beginning of the Quran. More
importantly, the 670" un-initialed verse from the beginning of the Quran is

9:127.

4.57 Ultimate Mathematics Connecting Sura 13
and Sura 19

The sum of frequencies of the usage of the initials HM in sura 13, as seen above,
is 1482. We also know that the 13” integer in the Quran is 19. Now, let us see
how one can generate the number of the frequencies of ae composed of five
Arabic letters and pronounced Kaaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Saad in sura 19. The number
1482 has four digits, 1, 2, 4 and 8. The first prime is 2, the second prime is 3,
the 4" is 7 and the 8" prime is 19. Let us assume these are the factors of a

composite number, then we have;

2x3x 7x 19 = 798. (4.64)

The number 798 is the sum of the frequencies of the initials ae in sura

98
19.

4.58 Ultimate Mathematics: Revelation and
Compilation Connection of Suras

As we have seen before, the number of verses from 1:1 to 19:98 is 2346. The
number 2346 is a composite and it is the 1998" composite and we can verify
that sura 19 has 98 verses. This is the way the Quran is put together in its
compiled version, however, in its revelation order as shown in table 3.1, 19:98
happens to be the 1365'” verse that was revealed. The index of composite 1365

is 1146 and we note that sura 114 in the Quran has 6 verses. Furthermore,
1365=3x 5x 7x 13. (4.65)

The indices of these prime factors are 2, 3, 4 and 6 and we are back to 2346

[5].
4.59 Ultimate Mathematics: Over it is 19

The function of the Ultimate Mathematics of prime numbers and their indices
is to inform us that not only is the Quran mathematically generated, but it is
generated with a mathematics far beyond our knowledge. The Quran challenges
us to acquire knowledge about it and not to summarily dismiss it.

Let us look at the number 4567. It is a very easy number to remember
because it is the combination of four consecutive digits. This number happens
to be a prime number and is the 619*” prime number. We can verify that 619 is
also a prime and it is the 114 prime and 114 is the number of chapters in the
Quran. Let us look at all the permutation group elements of 4567 in ascending

99
Table 4.23: Permutation group elements of 4567 with their ascending positional
indices

order. Table 4.23 illustrates this group of numbers the best way.

We see that the 19*” index corresponds to the group element 7456. Now let
us look at chapter 74 in the Quran, we note that 74:56 is the last verse in this
sura. In other words, sura 74 has 56 verses. Remember that this chapter is the
only sura where the number 19 is mentioned. The number 7456 is a composite
and it is the 6512'” composite and a quick look at the Quran reveals that chapter
65 has 12 verses. Note that chapters 74 and 65 are un-initialed suras and they
are the 45' and 37‘ un-initialed suras in the Quran, respectively. Another
quick look at the Quran reveals that chapter 45 has 37 verses.

Furthermore, 6512 and 7456 are the 23"¢ and the 19*” elements in the
permutation group of 1256 and 4567, respectively. It happens that 2319 is

the 1974" composite and we know that number 19 is mentioned in chapter 74.

4.60 Number of Initials in Chapter 29 and 31
and 43 and their Relation to Ultimate
Mathematics

Let us look at the number of initials ce (H.M.) in chapter 43 to 46. Table 4.24
makes it easy to see these counts [3]
Note the total frequency of the letter ° (Meem) in these four e>initialed

suras is 899. We have;
899 = 29 x 31. (4.66)

Remember, we started with sura 43. Now look at 43" TPC which is 1278.

Verse 12:78 is 1672" verse from the beginning of the Quran and

1672 = 19 x 88. (4.67)
The two numbers 43 and 88 are the key connectors. Let us do this:

19 x 88 = 1672, (4.68)
and,

19 x 43 = 817. (4.69)

101
These two numbers 1672 and 817 are the number of frequencies of ii (A.L.M.)
in chapters 29 and 31.

We also note that the number of frequency c + e (H + M) in sura 43 is
368. Number 368 is the index of composite 456 and 456 = 19 x 24. Note that
43 is the 24 initialed sura in the Quran and verse 43:1 eo is the 4324" verse
from the beginning of the Quran. Furthermore, 456 is the index of composite

559 and
559 = 13 x 43. (4.70)

Note, chapter 13 has 43 verses. We also note that the 13°” un-initialed sura
is sura 24 and the 24” prime number is 89 and chapter 43 has 89 verses.

Furthermore, 559% composite is 684 and;
684 = 19 x 36. (4.71)

Note, sura 36 is the 19*” initialed sura in the Quran.

4.61 More Quranic Facts Based on Ultimate
Mathematics

The Quran informs us that God revealed His final scripture, the Quran,
during the month of Ramadan. As I mentioned previously, the Quran is a
unique book having a property, never seen in any other literary work with 29
chapters having letters as first verse and in one case second verse, referred to
as “initialed” suras. These letters constitute a mathematical code connecting
the Ultimate Mathematics to the literal structure of the Quran. As we have
seen, this mathematical code is based on the number 19. The first initialed

sura is number 2 and the last one is sura 68. The number of verses in

102
every sura is mathematically coded and the positions and number of verses
are mathematically controlled.

Let us count all the initialed verses from 19:1 to 68:52, we find that there
are 1514 such verses. The number 1514 is a composite and it is the 1273"¢
composite. Note that 1273 is the frequency of word al (Allah) or God until
the end of sura 9. Furthermore, 1514 numbered verse from the beginning of the

Quran is verse 11:43. Remember that:
1143 = 9 x 127. (4.72)

Note also 1143’ composite is 1362 and 1362 is the number of verses from the
beginning of the Quran to 9:127. Therefore, the number of initialed verses from
19:1 to 68:52 which is the last verse in the last initialed sura points to the fact
that sura 9 has 127 verses. This takes us back to chapter 9 having 127 verses.
In sura 74 verse 30, God tells us ”Over it is 19”. Accordingly, the order of

gth

writing the digits 9, 1, 2 and 7 happens to be the 1 group element for the

permutation of these four digits in ascending order.

4.62 Ultimate Mathematics: Awesomeness of
the Quran

I have been explaining the Quran and its mathematical structure, based on the
Ultimate Mathematics of primes and their indices. I must say that there is
no end to the formidability of this structure. Let me now explain the following
mathematical fact from the Quran. Sura 38 in the Quran is called ” Saad” which
is an Arabic letter and it is initialed with the same letter. It happens to be the

20*" initialed sura in the Quran. Sura 47 is called "Muhammad”, and it is

103
the 20 un-initialed chapter in the Quran. Note that sura 47 has 38 verses.
Verse 38:1 is the 2147*” initialed verse from the beginning of the Quran and the
number of un-initialed verses up to this point is 1822 and 1822”"¢ composite is
2147. On the other hand, if we count the number of un-initialed verses up to
18:22, we find that there are 931 verses. The number 931 is 19 x 49 and note
that 49 is the 224 un-initialed sura in the Quran and 18 is the number of verses

in chapter 49.

4.63 Number of Verses in each Sura _ is
Mathematically Controlled: Over it is 19

I will introduce here an awesome mathematical structure and how the Ultimate
Mathematics, described in chapter two of this book, generates the Quran.
Chapter 42 has 53 verses and we shall see how the number 4253 is designed
beyond our imagination and how this number controls the number of verses
in chapters 45 and 46, the last two eo (H.M.)-initialed suras. Let us look
at the number 4253. We know that this number is a prime number and it
generates a special class of primes known as Mersenne primes. A Mersenne
prime, as described in chapter two, is of the form (2? — 1), where the power
or the exponent p is a prime number. If we raise 2 to the power of 4253 and
subtract one from the result, we obtain the 19” Mersenne prime. Let us look
at all the permutation group elements of 4253 in ascending order. Table 4.25
illustrates this numerical property the best way.

We see that the 19” index corresponds to the group element 5234. Now
let us look at the index of composite 5234, we find that it is 4537. If you look

at chapter 45, you note that it has 37 verses. The 22" index in table 4.25

104

is number 5342 and again it is a composite. The index of this composite is
4635 and a quick look in the Quran reveals that chapter 46 has 35 verses. Note
that 4253, signifying sura number 42 and its number of verses 53, controls the
number of verses in the last two ro (H.M.)-initialed suras, namely 45 and 46.
Note that we started with 4253 and if we assume that 4253 is written in octal
or base 8, then if we convert it to decimal or base 10 we get 2219. Note that
the group elements where we found the number of verses in suras 45 and 46 are

19 and 22.

4.64 Ultimate Mathematics

Again more proofs that the Quran is designed through the Ultimate
Mathematics of prime numbers and their indices. Many mathematical facts
are connected to sura 13 in the Quran and it was puzzling as to why 13? It

is a superstition in many cultures that the number 13 is an unlucky number.

105
Through these mathematical facts, we find that number 13 is another number
created by God. The 13” integer in ascending order in the Quran is 19.
Moreover, sura 13 is one of the initialed suras in the Quran and although it
is amongst a set of suras with HN (A.L.R.) initials, its initials are unique in
the Quran and they are HM (A.L.M.R.). This is like a hint to us that there
are profound proofs associated with this chapter. I should emphasize that the
mathematics introduced here is not the ordinary mathematics of elementary
level but a mathematics unknown to man and only known to God. This is to
again tell us that not only the Quran is mathematically coded, but it is coded
with a mathematics impossible for us to even imagine. I remind the reader that
proofs are formidable and cannot be performed, imitated or emulated by any one
except by God alone. Chapter 13 has 43 verses and we shall see how the number
1343 and its associated number 419 are designed beyond our imagination and
how this number generates the number of verses in the entire Quran.

Let us look at the number of verses that are prime in each sura and count
them. What do I mean by that? For example, sura 1 has 7 verses and there are
4 verses that possess a prime number as their verse number. These are verses
2, 3, 5, and 7. We continue to chapter 2 and we find that there are 61 verses
that have a prime number as their verse number. If we continue until the end
of chapter 13 we find that there are 419 verses with a prime number as their
verse number. In other words, 13:43 is the 419” verse in the Quran that has a
prime number assigned to it as verse number. The number 419 belongs to the
twin prime pair (419, 421) and it is the 22"¢ twin prime. The number 419 also

happens to be the sum of the 78" prime and the index of the twin prime 419,

106
22, i.e. 397 + 22 = 419. One immediately makes a connection between 22 and
78 where Sura or chapter 22 has 78 verses. Note also that if you multiply 78
by 19 you get 1482 which is the number of initials in sura 13. If we continue
counting the verses with a prime number as their verse number, we get to the
end of sura 60, the only sura in the Quran, which has 13 verses, we find that the
number is 1343. Remember that sura 13 has 43 verses. We knew this before,
but what we did not know is that if we look at the 419” lonely prime, we find
it to be 5003. I remind the reader that a lonely prime is obtained when the
twin primes are removed from the set of prime numbers. Therefore, the first
ten lonely primes are 2, 23, 37, 47, 53, 67, 79, 83, 89, and 97. Now if we add
419" lonely prime 5003 to 1343 we get: 5003+ 1343 = 6346. The student of the
Quran recognizes that 6346 is the total number of verses in the Quran, including
the 112 un-numbered opening statement, i.e., Bismallah. Note that 5003 is also
the 670" prime number. If we count all the un-initialed verses until the end of
sura 9, that is 9:127, we find that this verse is the 670" such verse from the
beginning of the Quran. Let us count all the verses with a prime as their verse
number from the end of chapter 13 to the end of chapter 60, the only chapter
with 13 verses, we get 924. The number 924 is the index of composite 1111 and
verse 11:11 is the 1482" verse from the beginning of the Quran and 1482 is
the frequency of the initials HM (A.L.M.R.) in chapter 13. If we count all the
verses from 13:1 to 27:30 where the missing opening statement of chapter 9 is
compensated, we find that there are 1482 verses. Again 1482 is the number of

frequency of initials in chapter 13. Remember as we previously mentioned 2730

107
is a TPC and it is the 78¢” such number and that

1482 = 19 x 78. (4.73)

Note also that 1482 is a twin prime companion and its index is 49 and the 49!”
un-initialed sura is chapter or sura 78. Now if we count the number of initialed
verses from 13:1 to 27:30, we find that there are 684 such verses and 684 = 19x36
and chapter 36 is the 19!” initialed sura. However, more importantly, the index

of composite 684 is 559 and
559 = 13 x 43, (4.74)

and we know that chapter 13 has 43 verses. If we subtract 684 from 1482 we
get 798 indicating the number of un-initialed verses between 13:1 and 27:30, but

more importantly, 798 = 19 x 42 is the number of initials in sura 19.

4.65 Ultimate Mathematics, Digit
Reproduction of 9:127

The design of the Quran through the Ultimate Mathematics Master Tablet
has shown us again all things are exact and there are no ”probabilities and
statistics”. I have referred to this mathematics as Ultimate Mathematics and
the number system of the Quran keeps it intact. Let me explain how this is done.
The number of verses where the word God has been mentioned until 9:127 is
790. The number 790 is 2698 written in base 19, i.e., (790)19 = (2698)19. We
know that 2698 is the frequency of the word God in the entire Quran. The
number of verses until the end of sura 9 is 1362. The index of composite 1362

is 1143 and

1143 = 9 x 127. (4.75)

108
The number of verses with a prime number as the verse number until 9:127 is

317 and,
790 — 317 = 473 = 11 x 43. (4.76)

The number 9127 is a prime and its index is 1131. If we subtract 790 from 1131

we get:

1131 — 790 = 341 = 11 x 31. (4.77)

4.66 Ultimate Mathematics generates 127
Verses for Sura 9

I should emphasize that the mathematics introduced here is not the ordinary
mathematics but a mathematics unknown to man and only known to God.
In order to better understand this mathematics, please spend some time and
study about prime numbers. The first time one comes across prime numbers and
their properties is usually in the seventh grade. I remind the reader again that
Ultimate Mathematics cannot be performed, imitated or emulated by anyone,
but God. We look at all verses where the word ail (Allah) is mentioned. We
record all the verse numbers with the word God and add them up. When we
reach 2:83, the sum of the verse numbers with the word God is 1362. This
number is exactly the total number of numbered verses from the beginning of
the Quran to 9:127. We know that the index of composite 1362 is 1143 and

that:
1143 = 9 x 127. (4.78)

This is only half of the story as it was previously known to us. If we count the

number of verses from 2:83 to 9:127, we find there are 1273 verses. Remember

109
that 1273 = 19 x 67 is the number of word God mentioned from the beginning

of the Quran to 9:127.[4]

4.67 Ultimate Mathematics Generates 127
Verses for Sura 9

According to 34:45 of the Quran, the mathematical structure of the Quran is ten
times greater than all the signs shown to the previous generations. I am going to
repeat this again that the mathematics presented here is based on the Ultimate
Mathematics of primes, composites, twin primes, TPCs and their respective
indices. The mathematics becomes more complex as primes and composites
that are partitionable into numbers with specific mathematical properties, such
as a prime and its index adding up to yield another prime. The mathematics
also transcends across number bases and other overwhelming phenomena. This
mathematics then generates the Quranic structure such as number of verses,
position of initialed and un-initialed suras, the verses containing the word God,
and many other Quranic structures, including positions of single letters.

Let me now tell you about a mechanism based on the Ultimate Mathematics

that preserves the Quran as it has been promised in the Quran by God.

15:9 — Surely, We have revealed the reminder and indeed We are its protector.

The mathematics again preserves the number of verses in the Quran and
points to chapter 9 having 127 verses. The frequency of the word God until
9:127 is 1273. Now we count the number of all verses where the verse number

is a prime number. For example, in chapter one, we have verses 2, 3, 5, and 7

110
as verses with a prime number as the verse number. Therefore, there are four
such verses in sura one. We then continue counting these verses until we reach
1273" such verse. This verse happens to be 55:19. It is also happens to be
that 5519” composite is 6346 which is the total number of verses in the entire

Quran.

4.68 Ultimate Mathematics Generates 127
Verses for Sura 9

15:9 — Surely, We have revealed the reminder and indeed We are its protector.

The mathematics again preserve the number of verses in the Quran and
points to chapter 9 having 127 verses. The number of the verses where the word
al (Allah) or God has been mentioned until 9:127 is 790. I also remind the
reader about what we know concerning 790. If you assume that the number
790 is written in base 19, then if we write it in base 10 it will be 2698. In other

words,

(790) 19 = (2698)10. (4.79)

The number 2698 is the total number of word aii (Allah) in the entire Quran.
The 790*” lonely prime is 9619. The reader immediately recognizes that chapter
96, the first revealed sura, has 19 verses. Furthermore, 9619 is the 1187" prime
number and 1187 happens to be a lonely prime as well, and it happens to be the
114* “lonely prime”. You recognize that 114 is the number of suras or chapters
in the Quran. The 1131** prime number is 9127, and 1131 — 790 = 341 and

341 = 11 x 31. These are some of the mathematical facts associated with the

111
number 790 in the Quran in order to refresh your memory. Now let us look at
sura number 7 and 13 in the Quran and how God has given us a hint and how
He relates these two suras through number 790. The first observation one makes
about sura 7 and 13 is that both these suras start with the initials ii (A.L.M.)
but do not belong to the six i (A.L.M.)-initialed suras. Sura 7 includes the
letter ye pronounced ” Saad” and sura 13 includes the letter _, pronounced ” Raa”
in their initials. Furthermore, the 7” initialed sura is sura 13. We know that
the total frequency of the initials HM (A.L.M.R.) usage in sura 13 is 1482. The
total number of verses in the initialed suras to the end of chapter 7 is 692 and,
1482 — 692 = 790. We see that we are back to the number 790 which is the

number of verses where the word al (Allah) is mentioned until 9:127.

4.69 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Sura 9
Having 127 Verses

15:9 - Surely, We have revealed the reminder and indeed We are its protector.
The mathematics again preserves the count of verses and points to chapter
nine having 127 verses. This time the mathematics crosses across number bases
and glorifies God by absolute submission to Him. The number of the numbered
verses in the un-initialed chapters up to 9:127 is 670. The total number of
numbered verses up to 9:127 is 1362, it is the 11434 composite, and we already
know that; 1143 = 9 x 127 and 1143 — 670 = 473 and 473 = 11 x 43. Now, let
us examine the verse 11:43. This verse is the 1514‘” numbered verse from the
beginning of the Quran. The index of the composite 1514 is 1273 = 19 x 67 is
exactly the total frequency of the word wi (Allah) or God up to 9:127. We know

that the 8 prime number is 19 and now let us assume that 1514 is written in

112
octal or base 8. If we write it in decimal or 10, that everyone is used to, we
5

obtain the number 844, i.e. (1514)g = (844)19. The number 844 is exactly the

number of verses in the initialed chapters up to verse 11:43.

4.70 Another Mathematical Fact

The number of suras in the Quran is 114 in which 29 of them are initialed.
This leaves us with 85 un-initialed suras in the Quran. There is a unique
mathematical property associated with the composite number 2985, as we will
see below. We know that every composite number can be factored out into

prime numbers. Therefore:
2985 = 3 x 5 x 199. (4.80)

The indices of the prime numbers 3, 5, and 199 are 2, 3, and 46. The number
2346 is the exact count of numbered verses until the end of chapter 19. We have
known this for a few years that the index of composite 2346 is 1998 and that

sura 19 has 98 verses and that
2346 = 23 x 2« 3x 17, (4.81)

where the indices of these primes are 9, 1, 2, 7. This again tells us that sura 9

has 127 verses.

4.71 Ultimate Mathematics; Sura 9 has 127
Verses

15:9 - Surely, We have revealed the reminder and indeed We are its protector.

113
The mathematics again preserves the number of verses in sura 9 as being
127 verses and this time points to the very first sura in order of revelation,
chapter 96. Again the mathematics crosses number bases and glorifies God by
absolute submission to Him. Let us study the first sura ever revealed, which
is chapter 96. The number 9619 is a very interesting prime. It is a lonely
prime and its index is 1187 which also happens to be a lonely prime. The index
of 1187 in the domain of lonely primes is 114, the number of chapters in the
Quran. As I mentioned, 9619 is a lonely prime and it is the 790 such prime and
(790)19 = (2698)19. Remember that 2698 is the number of times the word ai
(Allah) or God appears in the entire Quran. Therefore, verse 96:19 possesses a
pivotal role in the Quranic mathematical structure. Now, let us review the verse
9:127 and its mathematical properties. The number of the numbered verses in
the un-initialed chapters up to 9:127 is 670. The total number of numbered
verses up to 9:127 is 1362 which is the 1143" composite and we already know

that

1143 = 9 x 127, (4.82)
and;

1143 — 670 = 473 = 11 x 43. (4.83)

Now, let us examine the permutation group properties of the number 1362. We
can make 24, 4-digit numbers as shown in table 4.26.

Let us look at the group elements with indices of 1, 4, 9 and 19. The index
number | is 1236 and it is the number of numbered verses up to and including

9:1, and (1236)g = (670)i9. As mentioned above, 670 is the number of verses

in the un-initialed suras up to and including 9:127. Therefore, 1236 signifies
the beginning and ending of sura 9. Index 4, 1362, is the number of numbered
verses up to and including 9:127. The group element with index 9 is 2316. If
one assumes that 2316 is written in base 8 or octal, then is converted to the
decimal base it is 1230, i.e., (2316)g) = (1230)i9. The number 1230 is the
number of verses in the initialed verses up to and including 19:1. Number 1230
is also a TPC and happens to be the 42”¢ TPC. Number of initials in sura 19

is 798 = 19 x 42.

4.72 Ultimate Mathematics

We have seen so many times proofs of the counts of verses in the Quran and
that every sura is to have a specific number of verses and God has promised

that He has revealed the Quran and that He protects it.

115
15:9 — Indeed we have revealed the reminder and indeed we are its protector.

The Quran has been designed by a built-in internal self consistency check
based on mathematics of primes and their indices well beyond our knowledge.

There are two orders to the suras and verses in the Quran. One is the order
of revelation and the other is the conventional order. The order of revelation
places sura 96 as the first sura and the last sura as 110. The conventional order
is the compiled form as we see it today with sura one being ”the Opener” and
the last sura being *the People”. Accordingly, when we talk about verse 19 of
chapter 96, we should note that this is the 19'” verse that was revealed. We
shall see that this verse has a pivotal role in generating the number of verses in
sura 9. Therefore, when we count the number of verses in the Quran, we are
really counting them in two orders, conventional and revelation. We will see an
awesome proof of how these two orders of counting coincide to keep the count of
verses in sura 9 as 127. The count of verses from the beginning of the Quran until
9:127 in the conventional order is 1362. The index of composite 1362 is 1143 and
we know that 1143 = 9 x 127. Now if we count only the number of verses in the
un-initialed suras until 9:127 in the conventional order we get 670 and we have
the following relation between 670 and 1143; 1143—670 = 473 and 473 = 11x43.
Now, let us concentrate on 11 and 43, which are the indices of primes 31 and
191 and multiplying 31 and 191 will get us 31 x 191 = 5921. Keeping the two
numbers 473 and 5921 in mind, the 5921* verse in the conventional order is the

same as the 473” verse in the revelation order.

4.73. Ultimate Mathematics: Sura 9 has 127
Verses

The mathematics of the Quran is stressing the fact that natural laws must not
be violated lest we will have to suffer the consequences. Remember these laws
are based on mathematical equations and they create a perfect balance. Any
disturbance of this delicate order in the algebraic equation will be compensated
and equalized. Here again are proofs pointing to the fact that chapter 9 has 127
verses.

The new item about sura 9 having 127 verses is based on the permutation
group properties of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 6. Table 4.27 shows all 24-group
elements.

The first group element is exactly the number of verses from the beginning
of the Quran to 9:1. The 4*” group element 1362 is the number of verses from

the beginning of the Quran to 9:127. The 19” group element is the number of

117
verses from the beginning of the Quran to 96:19. Note that 96:19 was the 19¢”
verse revealed by God. These mathematical facts were mentioned above. Let
us now focus on the 22”¢ group element, 6231. This is exactly the number of
verses in the revelation order up to and including 9:127. The 6231** verse from

the beginning of the Quran is 114:3. Remember, 1143"¢ composite is 1362 and

1143 = 9 x 127.

4.74 Ultimate Mathematics Generates 127
Verses for Sura 9

Once again, we provide irrefutable mathematical proof, that chapter 9 has 127
verses. Let us look at the frequency of the word wl (Allah) or God in the Quran.
We note that in the compilation form of the Quran, the last usage of the word
God or its 2698" frequency is in verse 112:2. Now if we look at the order of
revelation of the verse 112:2, we find that it is the 333% revealed verse. Number
333 is 1143 written in base 19, i.e., (333)19 = (1143)19 and 1143 = 9x 127. From
1:1 to 9:127, there are 1362 verses and this number is a composite and it is the
1143"¢ composite.

The positional difference of 1362 and 1143 is: 1362 — 1143 = 219. The
number 219 written in base 8 or octal is 333 and 333 is 1143 written in base 19.

So we are back to 1143 = 9 x 127. Note also that the 8" prime is 19.

4.75 Ultimate Mathematics: Sura 9 has 127
Verses

The revelation the Quran occurred more than 1400 years ago. The order

of revelation was not the same as the compiled version that we have today.

118
This sophisticated system of two different numbering system is to preserve the
authenticity of the Quran and especially the number of verses in the Quran.
Indeed both the revelation and the compilation of the Quran are mathematically
designed and are the manifestation of the Ultimate Mathematics of chapter two
and they tell us that Quran is an eternal book. Let us see how Quran was
collected as the Quran which we have the privilege of reading.

75:16 — Do not move your tongue to rush it. 75:17 — Indeed, it is Us who
collects and makes it a Quran.

Now let us look at sura 92, called ”The Night”. This sura has 21 verse.
Note that 92 is the gematrical value of the word ” Mohammad” and chapter or
sura 21 is called The Prophets”. This is another Quranic numerical assertion
that the final prophet was Prophet Mohammad (33:40). A prophet, by Quranic
definition is a scripture-bearing messenger of God, therefore, Quran is the last

9!” sura revealed and remember

scripture revealed by God. Sura 92 was the
that the Quran was revealed in one night in the 9*” month of the lunar calendar
called Ramadan, again according to the Quran. The number 9221 is prime
number and its index is 1143 and as we have seen previously, 1143 = 9 x 127

and 1143" composite is 1362 and that 1362 is the total number of numbered

verses until 9:127.

4.76 Ultimate Mathematics: Mary and Jesus

We study the mathematics of the Quran looking for the proof that we are
dealing with the truth. The mathematics described in this section is from sura

19 in the Quran. We have seen that the order of revelation of the Quran and

119
the corresponding compositional order of the Quran has an awesome intricate
relation that could only be authored by God alone. Sura 19 is called ” Mary”
and it has 98 verses and the word «ll (Allah) or God has been mentioned in it
only 8 times. Note that 8” prime number is 19. Sura 19 is also the 6“” initialed
sura that was revealed. Note that 619 is a prime number and its index is 114
and 114 = 6 x 19. I remind the reader that 114 is the number of suras in the
Quran. The word al (Allah) or God is mentioned for the first time in verse 30
of sura 19. Note that 30 is the 19” composite. This verse refers to a great proof
or sign from God regarding the new-born baby Jesus speaking in the crib, and
it follows,

19:30 — He said: ” Indeed I am a servant of God. He has given me the
scripture and has made me a prophet.”

Again note, this is the new-born baby Jesus talking, by God’s command.
He is speaking to his mother’s accusers. According to the mathematics of the
Quran this verse has an important position, in order to show us and to prove to
us that this event actually happened. Verse 19:30 is the 114'” verse containing
the word AN (Allah) or God in the revelation order of the Quran. The number
114 is the number of chapters in the Quran. These awesome mathematical facts
are proofs that the Quran is the narration of God and these events actually did
occur, but since you and I were not there, God gives us the assurance in the
Quran and proves it to us by the Ultimate Mathematics, the master tablet of

the Quran.

120
4.77 True History of Jesus Supported by
Ultimate Mathematics

One of the themes of this Ultimate Mathematics is not to say that God has
begotten a son.
God is informing us in the Quran that the creation of Adam and Jesus is

the same. This is stated in sura 3, verse 59.

3:59 — Surely, the example of Jesus as far as God is concerned is just like
the example of Adam. He created him from clay and said to it, be, and it then
came into existence.

Accordingly, the frequencies of the words ” Adam” and ” Jesus” are the same
and both have been mentioned 25 times in the Quran. However, God has placed
an awesome code based on the number 19, further advising people not to say
that God has begotten a son.

If we look for the 19” frequency of the word ” Jesus”, we do not have to
look long, it is mentioned in chapter 19, which is named after his mother, Mary.

Jesus is mentioned in verse 34 of chapter 19. Let us see what 19:34 states.

19:34 — Such is Jesus, son of Mary. This is the true narration about which

they are in doubt.

If we look for the 19” frequency of the word ” Adam”, again we do not have
to look long, it is also mentioned in chapter 19. It is mentioned in verse 58 of

chapter 19. Let us see what verse 19:58 states.

121
19:58 — These are some of the prophets whom God blessed, amongst the
descendants of Adam and the descendants of those whom We carried with Noah,
and the descendants of Abraham and Israel and from among those whom We
guided and chose. When the revelations of The All Gracious is recited to them,

they fall prostrate, weeping.

The sum of these two verses, 34 and 58 is 92, and if inspect verse 92 of sura
19, we find the 19°” frequency of the word el (The All Gracious). Let us see

what this verse states.

19:92 — It is not befitting for The All Gracious to beget a son.

This admonishment is backed by the mathematical code based on the

Ultimate Mathematics of the Quran.

4.78 Ultimate Mathematics: Sura 9 has 127
Verses

‘ 9:1 — A reprieve has been issued from God and His messenger to those who
assign partners for Him who enter into an agreement with you.

The Quran warns the people who set up partners for God. This is also
the theme of the previous scriptures. The Quran was therefore revealed more
than 1400 years ago and its order of revelation was in a specific order different
from the compiled version that we have today. These two sophisticated different

numbering systems are a direct result of the Ultimate Mathematics of primes and

122
their indices and reveal eternal mathematical guards to preserve the authenticity
of the Quran, such as the number of verses in each sura of the Quran. The
mathematical fact that Iam about to explain, again assigns 127 verses to sura
9. Let us look at sura 9 and find out its order of revelation. We find it to be
the 113” sura that was revealed. Therefore, verse 9:1 in the compilation order
is 113:1 in the order of revelation. However, we know that 1131°¢ prime is 9127.

This again in a very straight-forward way tells us that sura 9 has 127 verses.

4.79 Ultimate Mathematics generates Sura 9
with 127 Verses

Sura 110, The Triumph

1 — When God’s support comes and the victory.
2-— You will see the people embracing God’s religion in waves.
3 — You shall praise the glory your Lord and ask Him for forgiveness, indeed He

is the Redeemer.

This chapter is the very last chapter revealed. Therefore, in the order of
revelation, it is the 114” sura. We see that it has 3 verses and we then have
1143. We know that; 1143 = 9 x 127, thus proclaiming that sura 9 has 127
verses. Remember also that from 1:1 to 9:127, there are 1362 verses and the
index of this composite is 1143 = 9 x 127. Note, this mathematics existed before

the physical existence of our universe and will outlast it.

123
4.80 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Suras
63 and 98 Having 11 and 8 Verses,

Respectively

Tabulating the primes and composites reveals that 821* prime is 6311 and 821**
composite is 988. Note, sura 63 has 11 verses and sura 98 has 8 verses. The
three digits of 821 namely 8, 2 and 1 are the indices of prime numbers 19, 3 and

2. These are the prime factors of 114. In other words,
2x3x19=114. (4.84)

Note, 114 is the number of suras or chapters in the Quran. Furthermore,
6311 is the 419'" Gaussian prime and the 419” lonely prime is 5003. The
419" prime numbered verse from the beginning of the Quran is 13:43. Note
1343 + 5003 = 6346 which is the total number of verses in the Quran, including

the 112 un-numbered opening verses i.e., Bismallah’s.

4.81 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Quranic
Parameters

A look at the 9" prime 23 and the 9*” TPC 102 reveals a profound mathematical
relation generating the number of verses in suras 19 and 9 of the Quran. The

TPC 102 can be factored out into its prime factors in the following manner
102 =2x 3x17. (4.85)

Now let us look at numbers 23, 2 ,3 , and 17. The indices of these primes are
9, 1, 2, and 7. We are back to 9127.

The product of these prime factors are;

2x 3x 17 x 23 = 2346. (4.86)

124
The index of the composite 2346 is 1998 and sura 19 has 98 verses.

A concatenation of the two numbers we started with, namely 23 and 102
yields the prime number 10223. The index of this prime number is 1254 which
is equal to 19 x 66. But more importantly, 1254 is the sum of the frequencies of
the three Arabic letters |, J, and P in the il (A.L.M.)-initialed sura, 30. Note
30 is the 19*" composite. Furthermore, if we assume that 1254 is in decimal,
then it is 2346 in octal, i.e., (1254)19 = (2346)g. We also note that 2346 is the

1998*” composite. We also see that
(1254) = (684)10. (4.87)

The number 684 = 19 x 36 and sura 36 is the 19*” initialed sura in the Quran.
Furthermore, the index of composite 684 is 559 = 13 x 43 and sura 13 has 43
verses. The index of composite 559 is 456 = 19 x 24 and sura 43 is the 19!”
initialed sura revealed and it is the 24” initialed sura in the Quran. The index
of composite 456 is 368 and 368 is the number of frequencies of the initials oe
(H.M.) in sura 43. The 9*”" prime is 23 and the 9'” composite is 16. These two
numbers are the factors of 368, i.e., 23 x 16 = 368. The 9” lonely prime is
89 and sura 43 has 89 verses. The 9" prime plus composite additive prime is
79(22) + 34(22) = 113 and the 9*” individual twin prime is 31, and sura 31 has
34 verses. The 9!” prime is 23 and the 9" composite is 16. The number 2316
is the 9'” permutation of 1236. Table 4.28 shows all 24 permutations of 1236.
1236 is the number of verses from the beginning of the Quran to 9:1. The
4*" sroup element is 1362 and 1362 is the number of verses from the beginning
of the Quran to 9:127. The index of the composite 1362 is 1143 = 9 x 127. The

The 9" prime number is 23 and the 9‘” composite is 16 and 23 x 16 = 368
happens to be the number of frequencies of the letters c (H) and ? (M) in sura

are the indices of composites 98 and 135. Chapters 19 and 20 have 98 and 135
verses, respectively.

Note, the 9” lonely prime is 89 which is the 24’ ordinary prime. A

chapter 43. The 9°” individual twin prime is 31 and when we look into the
number of initials il (A.L.M.) in sura 31, we find that the frequencies of il in
31 is 817 = 19 x 43. We further discover that the frequencies of the initials
ii (A.L.M.) in sura 29 which is the 8'”" individual twin prime is 1672. Note,

1672 + 817 = 2489 which is the number of frequencies of SH in suras 10 and 11.

4.84 Ultimate Mathematics Generates Quranic

We have learned so far that if we line up all primes and composites of various
kinds, such as primes, composites, positionally additive/subtractive primes, twin
prime pairs, exponents of Mersenne primes, Gaussian primes and so on, with
the same positional rank or index, these numbers generate sura numbers with
associated number of verses, as well as the frequency of number of initials in
the Quran.

With this in mind, let us look at the 7 such numbers. The 7”

prime is
17, the 7” composite is 14, the 7” prime plus composite with the same index

is the 19" prime and the 19” composite, i.e., 67 +30 = 97, the 7*” positionally

are the factors of composite 2147, i.e., 19 x 113 = 2147. 2147 is the number
of frequencies of initials e> in the 7 ce (H.M.)-initialed suras 40 through 46.
Table 4.29 shows all 24 permutations of 2147.

Note in table 4.29, 2147 is the 7” permutation and there are 7 primes,
denoted by (p). There are only two numbers in table 4.29 that are divisible of
19, and they are the 7!” and the 17% group elements. Note, the 17" prime is

17. The sum of these two numbers is;

2147 + 4712 = 6859 = 19 x 19 x 19. (4.88)

The 19!” group element is 7124 and the index of this composite is 6211. Note

129
chapter 62 has 11 verses. Verse 71:24 is the 2698"" verse in the un-initialed suras
and 2698 is the total number of frequency of the word wl (Allah) or God in the
Quran. Verse 71:24 is also the 1824" verse revealed in the un-initialed suras
and 1824 = 96 x 19 and sura 96 has 19 verses.

The 7*" twin prime pair is (59, 61) and the 7‘” exponent of Mersenne prime

is 19, as well as the 7!”

individual twin prime, and 59 x 19 = 1121 is the
number of initials in sura 40 through 42. The 7” positionally subtractive prime
is 53 — 16 = 37 and sura 42 has 53 verses.

The 7°” initialed sura in the Quran is 13, and the first group element in
table ?? is 1247, which is the index of composite 1482 and 1482 = 19 x 78 is
the frequency of the initials Ai (A.L.M.R.) in sura 13. Note, sura 13 is the 7"
initialed sura in the Quran. Furthermore, 1247 = 29 x 43 and sura 13 is the
29'” initialed sura revealed and sura 13 has 43 verses.

The 7" composite is 14 and the 7” twin prime pair is (59, 61) and sura
61 has 14 verses. The 7" prime is 17 and the 7” lonely prime is 79 and
17 x 79 = 1343 and sura 13 has 43 verses.

The 7" prime partitionable into a prime plus a composite with the same
index is the sum of the 19*” prime and the igth composite, i.e., 67 + 30 = 97,
and sura 67 has 30 verses. 19 x 67 = 1273 and 1273 is the number of frequency
of the word al (Allah) or God from the beginning of the Quran to 9:127. The
1273™¢ composite is 1514 and the 1514*" verse is 11:43 and 1143 = 9 x 127.
Furthermore, 1143'¢ composite is 1362 and 1362 is the number of verses from
the beginning of the Quran to 9:127.

Focusing on prime, i.e., 67 + 30 = 97, we find that 30 x 19 = 570 which is

130
the number of frequency of initials i (A.L.M.) in sura 32 and sura 32 has 30
verses.

The 7‘ Gaussian prime is 43, the 7‘ individual twin prime is 19 and
19 x 43 = 817 which is the number of frequency of the initials ii (A.L.M.)
in sura 31.

The 7‘ positionally additive prime is 24 + 89 = 113 and the frequency of
the initials A (A.L.R.) in both suras 10 and 11 is 2489. Note, the 11*” prime is
31 and the 10°” prime is 29, and 2489 — 817 = 1672 = 19 x 88. It happens that
1672 is the frequency of the initials i (A.L.M.) in sura 29.

The 7‘" Gaussian prime is 43, the 7'” individual twin prime is 19 and the
7” positionally additive prime is 24+89 = 113. Sura 43 has 89 verses and 43 is
the 24¢” initialed sura in the Quran and it is the 19” initialed sura which was
revealed. Furthermore, 19 x 24 = 456, and the index of composite 456 is 368
which happens to be the frequency of initials eo (H.M.) in sura 43.

The 7!” prime partitionable into a prime plus a composite with the same
index is the sum of the 19°” prime and the igih composite, i.e., 67 + 30 = 97,
and the 7” positionally additive prime is 24 +89 = 113. Note, sura 89 has
30 verses. The 7” TPC is 60 and sura 89 is the 60" un-initialed sura in the
Quran. Sura 30 has 60 verses and sura 89 has 30 verses.

The 7" positionally additive prime is 24+ 89 = 113 and the 7” positionally
subtractive prime is 53 — 16 = 37. Sura 30 is the 16” initialed sura and the
24*” initialed sura revealed.

The 7 individual twin prime number is 19 and so is the exponent of the

7't Mersenne prime. 7 x 19 = 133, which is the frequency of the initial ¥ in

131
sura 68 called ”The Pen”. Note, sura 68 is the the 29” and therefore, the last
initialed sura in the Quran.

Let us recap and see what Quranic parameters were generated.

Again lining up index 8 for primes, composites, twin primes, etc, we find that
the 8" prime is 19 and the 8" composite is 15. These two numbers, 19 and 15
are factors of 285 which happens to be the frequency of yy in sura 36 named
ow (Y.S.).

The 8" positionally additive prime is 127 and the 8” individual twin prime
is 29. These two numbers are the factors of composite 3683, in other words,
127 x 29 = 3683. Note, sura 36 has 83 verses.

The 8" TPC is 72 and the 72% composite is 98. Note, sura 98 has 8 verses.
Since the 8" prime is 19, then one concludes the fact that sura 19 has 98 verses.

The 8" lonely prime is 83 and the arithmetic series of numbers from 1

through 8 is 36, i.e., 1+2+3+4+5+4+6+7+8 = 36 and sura 83 has 36 verses.

133
The 8!" prime partitionable into a prime plus a composite with the same
index is 71(20) + 32(20) = 103 and the 8" twin prime pair is (71, 73). Note,
sura 73 has 20 verses.

The 8" prime is 19 and the 8" positionally subtractive prime is 43 and the
8 exponent of Mersenne prime is 31. Note 19 and 43 are the prime factors of
817 which is the frequency of the initials ii (A.L.M.) in sura 31.

The 8°" composite is 15 and the 8" twin prime pair is (71, 73) and the
734 composite is 99 and sura 15 has 99 verses and sura 99 has 8 verses.
Concatenation of number of verses in suras 19 and 15 yields 9899 = 521 x 19,
where 9899 is the frequency of the initials ii (A.L.M.) in sura 2. Note, 521 is
the 98" prime and 19 has 98 verses, and 19 is the 8“” prime and sura 98 has 8

verses.

Let us recap and see what Quranic parameters were generated.

We line up index 19 for primes, composites, twin primes, etc, we find that the
19'” prime is 67 and the 19!” composite is 30. These two numbers, 67 and 30
signify that sura 67 has 30 verses.

The 19!” positionally additive prime is 619 which is the sum of prime number
521 and its index 98. Here, 19 and 98 signify that sura 19 has 98 verses. Prime
number 619 is the 114” prime number and 114 is the number of suras in the
Quran. Prime numbers 19 and 521 are the factors of 9899 which is the total
frequency of the usage of the Arabic letters 1 J and e (A, L and M) in sura 2,
the first initialed sura in the Quran. The 8*" prime number is 19 and sura 98
has 8 verses.

The 19" lonely prime is 223 and the 19” individual twin prime is 109.
These two primes are the 48” and the 29'” prime numbers, respectively. We
can easily verify that sura 48 has 29 verses.

The 19*” positionally subtractive prime is 373, i.e., 463 — 90 = 373 and the
19*” composite is 30. The index of prime number 373 is 74 and verse 74:30
is the only verse in the Quran where the number 19 is mentioned. As for the
relevance of 90 and 463, the 90” twin prime pair are (3371, 3373), and we note
that sura 33 has 73 verses.

The exponent of the 19*” Mersenne prime is 4253 and sura 42 has 53 verses.

135
The 19!” Mersenne prime has 1281 digits and the 1281* verse in the un-initialed
suras corresponds to the 2743" verse from the beginning of the Quran and 2743
is exactly the number of verses in the initialed suras in the Quran.

The 19” Gaussian prime is 151 which is the 36” prime and sura 36 is the
19” initialed sura in the Quran. The 19*” twin prime pair is (281, 283). The
three digits in 283 are the indices of primes 3, 19 and 5. These are the factors of
285, i.e., 3 x 19 x 5 = 285 which is the the frequency of the usage of the Arabic
letters s and (» (Y and S) in sura 36 called (j) (pronounced ” YaSeen” ). As for
the other prime number 281, its digits are the indices of the prime numbers 3,
19, and 2. These are the factors of composite 114, i.e., 3 x 19 x 2 = 114 which
is the number of suras in the Quran.

Let us recap and see what Quranic parameters were generated.

Chapter 5

God’s Law

5.1 A Closer Look

The mathematics described in chapter two and its manifestation in the form of a
book called the Quran described in chapter four, serves as a strong motivation to
read the Quran and see what it actually says. The following two chapters reveal
a snapshot of what the Quran can teach us. A more detailed understanding
of the Quran is up to the reader and would only be possible through a careful

study of the Quran.

5.2 Equivalence

The harmony of nature portrays perfection and an inherent balance in its
system. The mathematics, described in chapters two and four, are a testament
to this phenomenon. The beauty of the universe stems from the fact that it
seems a single law can describe it and that it is governed by mathematical
equations. Mathematical equations describe every aspect of our world from
the tiniest subatomic particle to galaxies, the universe and the much theorized

multiverse. The question is as to why this is the case. The answer lies with

139
the title of this chapter and it is the balance that has to be preserved and
the balance itself establishes the ”law” for nature and thus its description with
mathematical equations.

Looking at a mathematical equation, we immediately recognize that in
order to preserve the equality, we must respect the fact that any mathematical
operation on one side requires the exact same mathematical operation on the
other side. For example in chemistry, a chemical equation must be ” balanced”
in order for the chemical reaction to take place in nature. Laws of physics
described by equations consistently point to conservation rules. Energy must
be conserved; momentum must be conserved; electric charge must be conserved
and so on. These conservation laws indicate consistency in nature’s behavior
and imply that God’s laws are eternal and that His system is immutable.

Equivalence or the balance inherent in nature also points to the fact that
forces exerted by various objects on each other in the universe are independent
of their size or magnitude. The Sun exerts the same amount of gravitational
force on the Earth or other planets as the Earth does on the Sun or other planets
on the Sun. As a matter of fact this balance has to be maintained at all times
for the orbit of the Earth to be stable. This property of nature governed by
mathematical equations indicates a fundamental law applying a universal justice
and equality across the board regardless of apparent power or magnitude.

A very small minority, namely humans are also an integral part of nature and
therefore are bound and governed by its laws. These laws were inspired by God
after creation of the physical existence we witness at the present time. These

laws based on mathematics dictates our daily interaction with the environment

140
around us and with each other. The best teacher for us is the example of the
nature we live in. Let us look at nature and see how it behaves. The Quran is
encouraging us to find out our place in the universe by examining nature and
learn about its conviction as it exactly obeys the laws inspired in it by God.

22:18 - Do you not see that to God prostrates everyone in the skies and
everyone on the land, and the Sun and the Moon and the stars and the mountains
and the trees and the animals and many people? However, many others have
truly deserved torment. And whomever God insults, as a consequence, no one
would respect him. Indeed God does whatever He wills.

Or;

81:15 - I therefore swear by the planets,-

81:16 - -perfectly moving in their orbits.

These verses clearly point to the fact of absolute obedience of God’s laws
by the entities who submit to Him. The warning in verse 22:18 highlights the
consequence of disobedience of God’s laws is continuous suffering and agony.
This is easy to understand that once God’s law is broken and the equivalence
is disturbed, God must bring order back by enforcing His laws which demand
re-establishment of the ” balance”. We see this clearly from the following verses.

55:7 - And He raised the sky and established the balance.

55:8 - Absolutely, do not violate the balance.

55:9 - And set the scales equitably and do not disturb the balance.

God emphasizes the importance of the balance and how important it is not to
violate it or disturb it. Another way of thinking about this is that disobedience

of God’s laws amounts to going against our own nature.

141
God's will is to give us absolute freedom to choose our path. He wants us to
learn and challenges us to examine the world around us by acquiring knowledge
and understanding of its inner secrets. We have the option to seek His help
to get an understanding of the world or to use our own methods with total
disregard to the source of knowledge. We can try them both and a fair-minded,
objective person would come to the conclusion that true knowledge only comes
from God.

He also augments the true knowledge with an important ingredient called
wisdom. Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge in the right way and not abuse

it to attain worldly gain and position and domination.

5.3. Heaven and Hell

God consistently warns people of the consequences awaiting them if they disturb
His balance. Scriptures such as the Bible and the Quran narrate allegorically
of what it was like before man set foot on this world. God tells Adam and his
mate that they can have everything except the forbidden tree. Although, they
did not respect God’s advice, it shows in a bigger picture that humans were not
ready to have everything at their disposal.

The balance or the equilibrium which God has created in this universe is
therefore not to our liking. The Quran as well as the Bible teach us that we
come from a place where we had everything at our disposal, except “this one
tree”, which we were not to approach, but because of our lack of wisdom, we did.
We therefore are spoiled and are not used to being rejected. In other words, we

are not used to an “equal and opposite reaction” to our action. The universe we

142
were projected onto has ”equilibrium” as its law and we must become content
and choose our ways and methods with knowledge and wisdom.

Heaven or Paradise is where those who pass the test have everything they
wish for. But this immense power is only given to those who have the knowledge,
the wisdom, the kindness, the love, the faithfulness and all those God-like
attributes that God tells about in the scripture. The empowerment of a group
is only contingent upon them totally submitting themselves to God. This is a
state of existence called Heaven. Lack of power and lack of possessing God-like

qualities is the state of existence called Hell.

5.4 Quran, a Fully Detailed Book

According to what we have witnessed so far, the Quran being a fully detailed
book is a statement of the ” Truth” made by the ” Author” of the Quran, God.
Our creator has sent us a book with all the knowledge and information we
require to lead a successful existence here, now and forever. This is to make
sure we have the resources to maintain respect for the balance that God has
created and gain wisdom to choose our path wisely. In studying the Quran, one
should not rush trying to explain it or understand it fully in a short period of
time. Sincerity is the key. A sincere approach to the Quran would ensure the
correct understanding of the Quran at the proper time. Ignoring God’s assertion
that He has explained everything in the Quran will propel one to follow other
sources for information. One would resort to history for historical facts, and
to scientific books to obtain knowledge in order to explain the Quran. When

students go to school and study different subjects, they generally do not ask

143
if the subject taught by the teacher is correct or the author of the book they
study has understood the subject at hand and has explained the subject matter
properly. For example, if one does not understand ” tensor algebra” or ” group
theory”, he or she usually blames him/herself for not being able to understand
it, in other words, the book is always right. This situation is usually reversed
for the Quran, in particular, or scriptures in general which are always blamed
for not being detailed in spite of God’s assertion to the contrary. God, on the
other hand tells us that He is the one who gives true knowledge and wisdom.
Obviously Solomon did not go to Harvard Law School to become a judge and
neither did Zul Qarnain study engineering at MIT to manufacture steel. Both
these men were given the correct understanding by God, for they knew that
the correct understanding comes from God to His obedient and appreciative
servants. These men as well as other examples we witness in the Quran were
always grateful to God for His blessings and recognized God as the source of
true knowledge and wisdom.

The case of Zul Qarnain is particularly interesting because God, in a very
simple language, tells us how to manufacture ”steel”. In sura 18 of the Quran,
God narrates the history of Zul Qarnain and his journey to a place between
the two palisades. He meets people whom he can hardly understand. These
people complain to him about the Gog and the Magog and how corrupt they
are. They ask him if he can make a barrier between them and the Gog and
the Magog. In verse 95 he says; “my Lord has given me many bounties.”,
therefore he immediately refers to the source of the ’ giving”, God. Invaluable

information on how to make an alloy with iron and carbon follows in verse 18:96

144
and has been at peoples disposal for almost 1,400 years. Today, we know from

the science of metallurgy how to produce steel by mixing iron and carbon.
5.5 Studying God’s Signs

I have been explaining to the reader that the Quran is composed according to a
mathematics which is beyond our understanding of math and yet easy to explain
to anyone who is willing to pay a bit of attention. Some people may say they
were never good at math, although many people are very good in balancing their
checkbook and remember many phone numbers including area codes, their social
security number, driver’s license number and many more numbers. Numbers we
are dealing with here in the Quran are small enough and God, in the Quran, is
challenging us in 27:83-84 to spend some time and pay attention, study them

and try to learn.

27:83 The day will come when we summon from every community a group

who rejected our Signs, forcibly.

27:54 When they arrive, He will say, “you have rejected My Signs, before

acquiring knowledge about them. Is this not what you did?”
5.6 Happiness, Now and Forever

A serious and sincere study of the Quran will increase our knowledge and add
to our wisdom. The path ahead of us is formidable. It is not easy to maintain
respect for the the equilibrium that God has created. As mentioned above, we

are not used to the type of limits imposed on us by mathematical equations. In

145
other words, we do not like to be told *no”. Overcoming this instinct takes time,
perseverance and strength of character and we eventually realize that none are
achievable without God’s help. The helping hand cones from God in the form

of acts of worship and performing good deeds.

5.7 Five Daily Contact Prayers; a Gift from God

One of the most important acts of worship is observing the dle, pronounced
salaat, or the contact prayer. This is a mechanism by which we think about God
and we thus avoid breaking His laws. Once we choose to submit to God, out of
His Infinite Mercy he inspires us to perform good deeds, and observe the contact
prayer and to give the cleansing charity (Quran, 21:73). God further tells us
in the Quran that the contact prayers must be performed in specific times.
There has been disagreement, historically, when these times are to be. God, in
the Quran, is very clear about these times and mentions these times in a most
specific way. Let us look at them very carefully. In 24:58, where God talks about
others requesting permission to enter one’s room at private moments in their
daily lives, He, specifically, mentions two contact prayers by name, ” Assalat-Al-
fajr” (the dawn contact prayer) and ” Assalat-Al-esha” (the contact prayer at
the time of the night when there is no light, i.e., after the twilight is gone). Note
here that God does not mention the so-called noon contact prayer, although,
He mentions *noon”. This is because, there is no so-called * noon prayer” , since
*noon” is not a period of time, but rather an instant in time, and obviously,
we can not finish our contact prayer in an “instant”. God, however, tells us

in 17:78 to perform the contact prayers in the period of the ”declining sun”.

146
This period starts immediately after *noon”. The same is true, for the so-called
sunset prayer. Sunset, again, is an instant in time and not a period of time.
God, therefore, appropriately has called this, in 11:114, as ” Zolafan min-al-lail” ,
which is the period of the night closer to the day or the period of night right
after the sunset. God tells us about the ”middle contact prayer” in 2:238. He
tells us that we should observe the ”contact prayers”, which in Arabic refers to
more than two, as well as the ”middle prayer”. This tells us that the number of
the rest of the contact prayers has to be “even” and it has to be more than two,
so that the middle contact prayer would be the third one and there will be at
least two remaining. The ”middle contact prayer” is usually due before sunset
in a time known as the late afternoon or ”asr”.

The awesomeness of the Quran is highlighted in 59:21. This verse is shown
below with its sequential position as 5145.

59:21 - Had We revealed this Quran to a mountain, you would have seen it
humbling itself reverently out of fear of God. And these are examples that We
cite for the people that they may think.

This verse is the key generator of the number of units of our daily contact
prayers. The number 59 is a prime number and it is the 17'” prime number. The
prime factors of the composite number 5145 are 3, 7, 7, 5, and 7. Furthermore
the composite number 5145 is the index of composite 5924 and note that sura
59 has 24 verses. The index of composite 5145 is 4459 and note again that sura
44 has 59 verses. Therefore, the position of the above verse tells us that two
suras in the Quran namely 44 and 59 have to have 59 and 24 verses, respectively.

Since, 5145!” verse is 59:21, then, let us look at the number 5921. We note that

147
the factors of 5921 are 31 and 191. The indices of the primes 31 and 191 are 11
and 43. The number 1143 = 9 x 127 and it confirms that sura 9 has 127 verses.
Moreover, the 5921** (31 x 191) verse from the beginning of the Quran happens
to be the 473”¢ verse revealed. The number 473 can be written as 473 = 11 x 43.
Now let us go back to the factors of 5145. They are; 3, 7, 7, 5, and 7. The
indices of these prime numbers are 2, 4, 4, 3, and 4, which are the number of
17 units of Sgle, or contact prayers performed daily.

A legitimate question would be, why this specific order in writing the prime
factors of composite 5145? The answer is that the number 37757 is equal to
17 x 2221. 17 being the number of units in daily contact prayers and 2221
is a prime and its index is the prime number 331 with an index of 67 which

is another prime, and happens to be the 19!"

prime. Furthermore, there are
exactly 67 twin prime pairs before the lonely prime 2221. Note that 67 is exactly
the number of times the word $gl. or contact prayer has been mentioned in the
Quran. Note also that 2221 is the 198” lonely prime and the index of composite
198 is 152 =19 x 8. Again note that 19 is the 8" prime number.

These are the result of the universal generators for the Quran according to

the Ultimate Mathematics described in chapter two.

Chapter 6

Quran Description of
Existence

There have been many theories describing where we come from and why we and,
in general, things simply exist and the beginning and the end of our universe.
A very powerful and fundamental fact stated in the revelation of the scriptures
in general, and the Quran in particular, is the fact that creation began with
different laws only known to God or the Creator. These laws, of course, were
completely perfect and had no flaws. The existence we witness today, including
our own, is the by-product of God’s will according to the absolute truth. Laws
governing our universe and the multiverse came into existence after the creation
of the multiverse. These laws are different even in different layers of our own
corner of the multiverse which we refer to as our universe. Let us see what the
Quran says in the following segment from chapter 41, verses 9 through 13,
41:9 - Are you disbelieving in the One who created matter in two days and
are you setting up likenesses for Him? Such is the Lord of the multiverse.
41:10 - And He placed stabilizers therein and blessed it and exactly measured

its forces in four days, to equal the needs of those who seek it.

149
41:11 - Then He balanced the vacuum, and it was a smoke, He then said to
it and to the matter; ”Come into existence willingly or unwillingly.” They said;
we come willingly.

41:12 - He then completed them as seven vacua in two days, and He inspired
in each vacuum its law. And We adorned the lowest vacuum with lamps, and
placed in it guards. Such is the design of The Almighty, The All Knowing.

Therefore, we see from the above verses that God brought into existence the
skies and the land or the old notion of Heavens and Earth or more accurately
vacuum and matter and only then He established the laws governing them. In
fact, verse 12 speaks the same language as the Book of Genesis in Torah, where
it states that God said; ”let there be light”. Lamps are the first stars forming
in the the lowest sky or vacuum and thereby creating the visible region of the
electromagnetic spectrum known as light. Figure 6.1 shows a topological view
of the seven layers mentioned in the Quran.

The way to think about the layers in this illustration is, for example, the
innermost or the lowest sphere should be considered as the surface of a ball with
two extra dimensions. This surface is where we exist and so do an estimated
hundreds of billions of galaxies. Of course we cannot imagine a four dimensional
surface, since we can only point in three dimensions, namely x, y, and z. For us
there is no inside or outside of the sphere, we are bound to the surface only.
As we see there are no visible connections between two consecutive layers. As a
matter of fact the layers are spanning in an extra infinite dimension, where its

properties are completely unknown.

150
Figure 6.1: A topological view of the 7 layered universe

The formation of matter into galaxies, stars and planets teaches us a lot
o'

about the existence of a just, benevolent and generous Creator.

6.1 Justice

A simple study of the universe and everything it contains, tells us that
mathematical equations govern the entire universe. For example, Newton’s law
of gravitation is a balancing act between two massive objects exerting equal and
opposite force on one-another. The Sun and its planets are a good example, as
the Sun force on each planet is the same as the force exerted by each planet on
the sun.

This balancing act without an iota of violation, has kept the solar system
together for billions of years and will keep together for years to come. A lesson

to be learned in these mathematical equations, also governing every atom and
sub-atomic particle, points to a universal equilibrium or ”justice”. Although
the Sun is the most massive object in our solar system, it never exerts more
force on the planets than the planets, with much less mass, exert on the Sun.
Consequently, the Sun never violates the balance just because it is “more”
massive. We can think of truthfulness as a mathematical equation. If someone
is honest and truthful, he or she respects the balance that God has created. Lies
and deceitfulness create falsehood and violate the the equilibrium that God has
created and maintains. The Quran talks about the balance that God has created
and admonishes us not to violate the balance.

55:7 - And He raised the sky and established the balance.

55:8 - Absolutely, do not violate the balance.

55:9 - And set the scales equitably and do not disturb the balance.

Therefore, now it becomes clear to us what the scriptures refer to as ”sin”.
Sin is disturbing God’s balance, transgression of God’s laws which are based on

absolute justice.

6.2 Generosity

It is for our own well-being that we must obey God’s natural laws and behave
just like nature. Remember, we are part of nature and if we are in unison with
nature, then our soul and our body are at peace with each other and happiness
and contentment will follow. Accordingly, God shows us His signs and proves
to us that He exists and that He is also Possessor of Infinite Generosity.

Let us look at the a picture of our solar system on many websites available

on the Internet. We note that the Sun and the planets and their moons are all

152
spherical. The question is then why are they spherical? Why not cylindrical
or cubical? Sphere obeys spherical symmetry providing infinitely manifold
symmetry. In other words, looking at the Sun from any given direction yields
the same view. This implies the unbiased nature of the law governing spherical
symmetry. On the contrary, a cube has only a six-fold symmetry and therefore
depends very much on the point of view of a given observer.

Another important and intriguing facet of sphere is its volume to surface
ratio. To make this point, I choose three different geometrical objects, namely

a sphere, a cylinder and a cube. The volume V of a sphere with radius r is;

The surface area A is;

A=4nr? (6.2)

The volume to surface ratio is then;

= 0.33r. (6.3)

BIS

Now, let us look at a cylinder having the same height as its base diameter.
This cylinder shape would give the optimum volume to surface ratio of any other
kind of cylinder. Now we require the cylinder to have the same surface area of

that of the above sphere.

153
cyl = 27 +2r = 67 6.4
Acyt = 20R(2R) + 20 R? = 6 R?

Acyt = Aspn = 4? (6.5)
60 R? = 4dr? (6.6)

R= 0.816r. (6.7)

(6.8)

The volume of the cylinder with R = 0.816r and a height of 1.832r is;

Vey) © 1.097r*. (6.9)

The volume to surface ratio for the above cylinder is;

Vey
Acyl

~ 0.27r (6.10)

Now, we move to a cube of side a, with the same surface area of the sphere

with radius r.

Acup = 6a” (6.11)

Acube = Asph = 40? (6.12)
6a? = Arr? (6.13)

a 1.45r. 14

1.45 (6.14)

(6.15)

The volume to surface ratio for the above cube is;

154
Veube ~ 9 24p, (6.16)

cube

Inhabitants of the Earth live on the surface of the planet and their provision
such as minerals, water, oil, coal, and nutrients are stored inside the inner
volume, therefore, the ratios of the V/A is a measure of the provisions available
for the inhabitants for a given geometry described above. We denote the V/A
ratio by P for ’ provision”. We then can compare P for the sphere with P’s for

the cylinder and the cube.

Peyi
—— =z 0.82 6.17
Porn (6.17)

A cylinder would have 18% less provision than a sphere.

P,
acube ~ 0.73 (6.18)

‘sph
A cube would provide 27% less provision than a sphere. These simple
observations followed by very little efforts prove not only ultimate intelligence,
but it also points to a spiritual aspect such as generosity, kindness, mercy, and

grace.

6.2.1 More Generosity

Another look at the above ratios for the sphere, the cylinder and the cube reveals
the fact that the provision P is a function of the radius r. Since, we proved
the sphere provides the maximum provision, we look at all ’ terrestrial” planets
and the moons in our solar system. We make this choice, because gas giants,

namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune have no solid surface to stand on.

155
Figure 6.2: Images of the four innermost terrestrial planets

The following images of these planets and moons show that the Earth is the
largest one of them all. According to the above equations, the Earth provides
the maximum provision. |6][7]

Figure 6.3: Images of major moons in the solar system and the Earth for

comparison.
The population of the Earth is about 6.7 billion and the people live on the
surface in homes defined by an area in square meters or square feet. Land to sea
2

ratio for Earth is approximately 3/7 and this means the land masses on Earth

156
have a surface area of about 153,000,000 square kilometers (km), assuming an
average Earth radius of 6,368 km. This yields a population density of = 44
persons/km?.

Now let us look at what if we were inhabiting Mars instead. The radius of
Mars is 3,397 km and, for the same population density calculated above, the
provision per person would be less by a factor of ~ 1.87. This means that for
the same area home on a Mars-size Earth, every creature would be poorer by
almost a factor of 2!_ We never think about this and some do not care and
continue to complain and be ungrateful! Therefore, this is not by accident that
we happen to be here on Earth, the largest of all terrestrial planets and moons.

This is a direct consequence of God’s infinite generosity.

6.3. God’s Laws

God created everything without any flaw and we are invited to look at the
creation of The All Gracious over and over, only to be humbled and subdued by
His flawless creation (Quran, 67:3, 67:4). As our knowledge of God’s creation
increases according to His will, we therefore become more and more responsible
to behave in a more righteous way in order to please our Creator. God informs
us in the Quran that when He commanded the skies and the land to come into
existence, they were given the option to come ” willingly” or unwillingly”, to
which they responded that they will come ” willingly’ (Quran, 41:11). This
shows that these awesome creations have completely submitted to God. God,
then inspired the laws for every universe and these are the physical laws that we

observe in nature today. We must remember that God’s laws are perfect and

157
they must be models for us in order to be happy and content in this life as well
as preparing ourselves for the hereafter.

As a physicist, studying and teaching properties of atoms, nuclei and
particles, I have been always fascinated by the so-called ” Pauli Exclusion
Principle”, which in essence, states that no two like objects can occupy the
same space. God’s laws tells us that “strength” of atoms, nuclei and particles
as a community existing in harmony is because of their internal differences. Let
me explain how. The hydrogen atom is the simplest atom in the universe. It
contains one proton and one electron. If one is to make a helium atom, we
have to have two protons in the nucleus and two electrons. First, we investigate
the second electron. The second electron occupying the same orbital cannot be
exactly like the first electron and has to be different. The second electron must
possess the opposite ’spin” in order to be able to form the Helium atom. Now
let us look at the nucleus. Remember that we need two protons to make the
nucleus of the Helium atom. One can not put two protons even with opposite
spins in the nucleus, we must “include” a second particle called *neutron” in
order for the nucleus *community” to survive. Neutrons are very different from
protons by not having any electrical charge. It turns out that the most stable
Helium nucleus must have two protons and two neutrons. If we compare the
strength of the nucleus to that of the atom, we note that the nuclear strength
is millions of times greater than that of the atom. If we go one step further
inside the proton or the neutron, we find even smaller objects, called quarks.

Je find that there are three quarks inside the proton. Now this time, it is

not enough only for the spins and the electric charges to be different, but the

158
quarks must possess different ’ color” and ” flavor”, in order to form a ”strong” ,
and “harmonious” community called the proton.

Let us see how strong this community is. This time we can not compare
to the strength of the nucleus, since the strength is so high that no free quark
has ever been observed. Why all these differences? It turns out that such an
arrangement of “unlike” objects as building blocks for the entire universe is
the most economical way of construction of all things. This is why God does
not love wastefulness and He warns us about not being wasteful. We must
remember that all these particles are constituents of our universe including our
physical bodies. These objects have fully submitted to God’s laws. This is how
God created His colorful creation. He requires differences to be the source of
strength and beauty.

We humans always complain about our misfortune and we seldom conform to
God’s laws. How can we be happy and prosperous outside God’s laws? People
segregate themselves according to class, race, color, and any other differences
small or large, while as we just noted, God has decreed integration. Millions
of people are killed and maimed because people do not like the way God has
created us. These are the objectors and God has decreed "SUBMISSION” as
a requirement for all the people. The problem of objection to God’s system
not only brings us misery in this temporary life, but it will forever buy us the
eternal agony of being eliminated from God’s kingdom. God describes this state

of existence as ” Hell”.

159
Figure 6.4: The structure of the proton.

6.3.1 Building blocks of matter

The smallest and heaviest building block of matter is the nucleus of the H-
atom or the proton. As far as we know, protons are stable and do not decay.
Dedicated experiments such as Super-K [8] have measured a lower limit of the
proton lifetime to be 8.2 x 10°° years. This is 107° larger than the estimated
age of the universe! Note the above number for proton lifetime is simply a lower
limit and no proton decay has ever been observed.

Figure 6.4 shows the inner structure of the protons. The objects designated
as” u” (up), ”u” and ”d” (down) are called quarks. Each quark carries a fraction
of the electric charge of the proton. The u-quark has +2/3e and the d-quark
has -1/3/e. Therefore, the charge of a proton is Ze ~ Ze = te = +e. The wavy
lines connecting the quarks are symbolizing the interaction among the quarks.

160
The force binding the proton together is referred to as the “color” force. It
is transmitted by a particle called the ”gluon” which actually carries a given
color. The ’color” force is the strongest force in nature. As a matter of fact, it
is so strong that no free quark has ever been observed. The quarks are eternally
confined inside the proton. In particle physics this phenomena is called ” quark
confinement” .

The color force has two components;

Ve = —= 2 + kr. (6.19)
r

The first term in the above equation makes sure that quarks always keep
a minimum distance from each other. This is called asymptotic freedom. The
second term ensures quark confinement. This balance is maintained in a sphere
with a radius of 0.875 fm (Fermi) or femtometer. One fm is 10~15 of a meter.

The colors of the quarks ” MUST” be different. As shown in figure 6.4, we
must have a “red” quark, a ”blue” quark and a ”green” quark. This ensures
that a proton and all its hadronic siblings, such as neutron, pions and kaons
are ’colorless”. As mentioned above, the particle mediating the color force also
carries a color charge, thus, quarks continuously change their color.

This is how the basic element of our existence is put together to ensure our

creation and survival.
6.3.2 <A lesson to be learned

Let us apply the lesson of the proton with its community of quarks to our social

problems. Remember, the proton and its quarks are completely submitting to

161
God and have come into existence with absolutely no reluctance or objection
to God’s system. We have ascertained that the proton community is the most
tightly bound community ever. But why?

We observe that the quarks must be different. In other words, we CANNOT
put in three red or blue or green quarks inside the proton; it would not bind.
The color force ensures an ” affinity” between the quarks of different color by not
letting them to get too far from one-another, i.e., confinement. It also ensures
that they respect each other’s territory by imposing the asymptotic freedom”.
Quarks do not care about their color by continuously changing their color, thus
having no bias to a specific color. These are natural laws inspired by God to
maintain the existence of everything, including us.

Now let us see how we reflect upon these natural laws inspired by God. We
prefer one color over another. We want to mingle with our own kind. We do
not respect territories of others and like to aggress against them. These are
unnatural behaviors and are against God’s natural laws. If one has tendencies
of aggression, prejudice, racism, and selfishness, then he or she would be at
a constant war with his or her body which has absolutely submitted to God.
This is how unhappiness, misery, fear, depression, and suspicion takes over an

individual or a people.

6.3.3. Heaven or Hell

The state of mind described in the above section, has a frightening consequence.

We noted the lifetime of a proton is greater than ~ 10°4

years. The laws inspired
by God are absolutely perfect and are enforced. Imagine, a proton containing

three individuals with different racial, cultural, or traditional backgrounds.

162
These three individuals, according to their state of mind are either submitters to
God or objectors to Him, they will be either in Heaven or in Hell, all depending
on their state of mind. Remember there is no way out. Let us see what the
Quran describes Hell to be like;

22:21 — And they will be confined in iron pots.

22:22 — Every time they try to get out because of the misery, they will be
returned to it and taste more of the suffering of the inferno.

The concept of Hell must NOT be taken, as some may think to portray God
as a mean and vindictive god, but as a god who has created perfect laws and
He is the one who holds and binds all things according to the truth and every
other opinion, not according to His laws, is false and is doomed to fail. God
describes the situation to us in the Quran.

35:41 - Surely, God holds the skies and the land, lest they will vanish. They
would certainly vanish if anyone else besides him held them. Indeed He is
Tolerant, All Forgiving.

He, therefore, wants us to learn about His system and submit to Him, gain
wisdom, suppress our worldly desires and attain peace and harmony for an

eternal existence.

6.4. ”God Alone”

The simple statement of God Alone implies a system having a single driving
force and this is in complete agreement with the way nature works. This is
also the “natural” instinct that God has put into our system (Quran, 30:30)

and opposing God’s system brings unhappiness and would have disastrous

163
consequences to our existence now and forever. Quran clearly emphasizes this
over and over. As we have seen in Chapter 4, these are not unsubstantiated and
hollow statements, but are supported by awesome mathematical proofs which

render this fascinating book, the Quran, absolutely infallible.

6.5 Commemorate God Frequently, Call Him
with His Most Beautiful Names

God teaches us what we do not know (Quran, 96:5). He is our Creator and
He knows our innermost thoughts. He has created us with the natural instinct
of monotheism (Quran, 30:30). Happiness in this life and closeness to God in
the hereafter requires that we go along with God’s system or in other words go
along with our own nature. The more we obey God, the happier, and the more
successful we will be and will be in peace and harmony with God’s creation. Let
us think about God’s laws of the physical universe. Why is it that we can build
faster planes, better cars, better computers, faster and more efficient rockets
and spaceships and submarines? The answer is, because we are being taught
by God how to obey His laws better and better. God’s law for our success here
in this world as well as the hereafter is very simple and He is telling us that
”*There is no god except God”. We have two options given to us by God, one
is to accept this and second is to subscribe to conjecture and reject this truth
and do not abandon other gods. The first option brings prosperity and peace
of mind and the second option will direct us to Hell as an eternal abode, as it
was described in the above sections.

Many people choose the second option and we see them every day,

commemorating others besides God and asking for help from others besides

164
God. They even go further to assign a son for God, an unsubstantiated claim.
It is below God’s Dignity to beget a son (Quran, 19:92). God is the Creator of
the skies and the land, He is the Creator of what we see and what we do not
see. We must resist these temptations by seeking refuge in God. The Quran,
like previous scriptures the Old and the New Testaments, repeatedly warns of
an entity called Satan. Satan or the Devil is determined to prove God wrong.
God reminds us in the Quran not to take the Devil’s side for he is our most
ardent enemy. Quran, therefore, encourages us to worship God Alone, and not
to set up partners for Him. The function of the Quran is to take us out of the
darkness into the light (Quran, 14:1).

God introduces Himself to us in the Quran and tells us who He is. He tells
us that the Quran is complete and fully detailed”. He tells us that we should
call God with the names He calls Himself in the Quran (Quran, 7:180). Calling
God “akbar”, meaning ” greater” which is not one of His names, used in the
popular phrase such as ” Allaho akbar” (God is greater) is opposing the word of
God, as it is stated in 7:180. One also should remember that if an attribute of
God is not in the Quran, then it is simply not one of His attributes. God calls

Himself ASI (Al-Kabeer), meaning The All Magnificent.

6.6 Wives are Assigned Wages

There are traditions in every society and people practice them without ever
questioning their source or their validity. These traditions over thousands of
years have taken the form of ’culture” and are used as laws or accepted norm in

different societies. A people having the same culture usually look upon others

165
who have a different culture as inferior. Some of these cultural and traditional
behaviors are so deeply rooted that they often replace God’s laws. Once this
blind replacement of God’s laws with man-made traditions is practiced, misery
and unhappiness follow.

One such disobedience of God’s laws is ignoring His laws in the case of
marriage. If we look in the Quran, we never find the word “dowry” in the
Arabic text. However, God is the protector of people, and He knows that
male-dominated societies abuse women’s right. It is customary, and has been
for thousands of years to have a pre-nuptial agreement, called *mahr” never
mentioned in the Quran, when a man and a woman get married. God knows that
this is no more than a lip-service and does not give women economic freedom in
the form liquid asset” and women will be slaves to the will of their husbands
for the entire duration of their married life.

God, therefore, uses the word ja >) rea *Ujoorahunna”, which simply
translates to “their wages” and not ”their due dowries” as it is traditionally
translated. God wants to free women from traditions, frequently designed by
men who did not have faith in God. The word ” housewife” has been used and
is used as a term meaning the lowest class of women, whom by the definition of
modern societies, are incapable of doing any other form of useful work and that
is why they are simply “housewives”. These traditions are designed to enslave
women and to take all economic freedom away from them. This is exactly
why in today’s societies women have to get out there and work for economic
independence. Housewives provide services that - as a rule - cannot be provided

by a single individual. They cook, do the laundry, take care of the children, clean

166
the house, run errands, shuttle the children around, do the grocery shopping,
and provide clean and divinely approved love for their husbands. For these
services provided all year round with no vacation, they get absolutely ” nothing” .
One has to think how much would it cost if all these services were to be bought
from outside. Women often are the objects of insult and bodily harm by their
husbands. This is their wage for a selfless service provided at home.

Note the wage is the wife’s *money” and cannot be used for grocery shopping
or other household necessities. This is to give some dignity to women by

providing them with liquid asset to spend it as they wish, with no supervision.

6.7 The Meaning of (2 I ”Al-Ardh” in the

Quran

God created in His Infinite Wisdom the Heavens and the Earth according to a
perfect design. God tells us that the skies and the land were one solid mass and
He separated them. God tells that His ”land” is spacious, therefore, we should
worship Him alone. He also tells us that He created all the living things from
water. After God has increased our knowledge through the Hubble telescope
and new information from the Mars lander and the evidence of ice on the moon,
we realize that God has stored provisions for humans throughout the universe
and it is not limited to Earth as we wrongly believed. Our galaxy, the Milky
Way, has a diameter of 100,000 light years. There is news that a smaller galaxy
called Sagittarius Dwarf, about a tenth of the Milky Way is in a state of collision
with our galaxy. Do not be alarmed, it takes 100,000 years to travel from one
end of the Milky Way to the other end, if one goes at the speed of light. There

are more than two hundred billion stars in our galaxy and we have information

167
that planets like Earth and Mars revolving around them. We already know that
there is water on Mars, and God has given us the know-how to make a planet
like Mars habitable or terraform for ourselves. God also talks about mountains,
and we know that mountains are not unique to Earth and it is a feature of the
rocky planets and their moons. God tells us that all mountains will be wiped
out, when the cosmos expires. He has created us from dust and we know that
there has been exchanges between different bodies in the universe. In other
words, we are created from ”star dust”.

Also an alternate understating of the skies and the land is that they really
mean ”vacua” and ”matter”. This understanding can equally be valid and it

shines a different light of our understating of the Quran.

6.8 Creating a god

God repeatedly commands us to read His Book, the Quran. This is a Mercy
from God that He has sent down the Quran to us to point out and refer to God’s
word and warn the people from the evils of infidelity and setting up partners
for God. To the majority of people God is a mystery. Books have been written
and billions of dollars or other currencies have been spent and are being spent
by ignorant individuals to explain who God is and what His relation is to His
creation. Unfortunately, the god being introduced in man-made books, and
sought by many people is a creation of the mind and has nothing to do with
God, Creator of all things. I emphasize that the Quran describes its Author,
God, in a fully detailed way. This is an assertion by God, Himself that the Quran

is complete and fully detailed. The question remains; do we believe when God

168
makes such a statement of truth or do we continue to avoid these Quranic facts
and follow conjectures? Where else do we find God being described as He is in
the Quran? Do we have another book where we can find answers to questions we
have? Describing God, without being mindful of the Quran will lead us astray
and eventually we will create a god for ourselves compatible with our wishes or
we go so far astray as to ask questions in our mind about God that are baseless
and could render us completely unfaithful.

The key to understanding God is to refer to the Quran and learn about
His Most Beautiful Names. These are Names befitting God since He has
chosen them as His attributes and who knows God better than God? People
have tried to be “nice” and “respectful” to God by calling Him the father.
According to the Quran, fatherhood for God is a falsehood and it is below
God’s dignity. Remember that one of God’s attribute or Most Beautiful Names
is KAI pronounced ” Al-Mutekabbir” meaning ”The All Dignified” or the one
who reflects His Greatness in everything He does. Some people who have a
human concept of God, dwell in the idea of who created God. Since humans
and everything we see are created, they expect God to be created as well. God
informs us in the Quran that He is the Creator, He creates what He wills and
what we do not know. Remember, the law of equilibrium, created by God for
us in this universe, requires conservation laws. This is why we like to have
offspring, so we can leave our footprint. These laws do not exist for God. God
does what He will with no resistance to His will.

Reading the Quran from cover to cover and reading it as much as you can is

the key (Quran, 73:2). The Quran tells us to seek refuge in God from Satan the

169
rejected, when we start reading the Quran (Quran, 16:98). We should not read
the Quran for the sake of finding answers to our questions by referring to a part
or a specific verse in the Quran. This is the way of those who are impatient
and God tells us He is with those who wait. If we do not understand a verse in
the Quran, we should be patient; God reveals the understanding of His verses
at certain times. Had He revealed it above and beyond our understanding, it

would have been harmful to us (Quran, 5:101).

6.9 God’s Forgiveness After Death

God repeatedly informs us that He forgives all sins except for those who set
up partners for Him and die with such a conviction. The process of forgiveness
is done by God on the Day of Judgment for the people who seemingly do not
deserve it, but God’s forgiveness is ever-expanding and there is no stopping
it. We learn from the Quran that this process is initiated by God when we
humble ourselves, acknowledge our mistakes and ask God for forgiveness. God,
then opens up the gates of His infinite blessings and forgives us. This process,
according to the Quran will not be exclusive to this world and reaches beyond
this worldly life to after our death. This may come as a shock to some people.
However, God tells us that there will be a lot of surprised individuals in Hell
who will ask, where are those whom we deemed wicked?

God informs us about men in a place called Purgatory, who recognize people
in Heaven and in Hell by their looks and ask God not to place them in Hell.
God answers their call. God wants us to stay close to Him in this world and

to not drift away so that our hearts harden and we cannot remember God and

170
are unable to invoke His name. Once the heart hardens even harder than rock,
then there is no escape and eternal suffering will be with individuals having such
hearts. Lessons from the Quran to be learned are; to stay close to God and take
Him as our friend and ally. Remember that we have no ”true” friend, except
God. When we are dead and gone, our closest friends and relatives forget about
us, but God remembers us and cares for us and does this with no conditions or
self interest. God’s love for us is absolutely unconditional, unlike the so-called
human love that comes with strings attached. We should take advantage of His
infinite grace and open our heart to Him and ask Him to help us in all our tasks.
This brings humility to our hearts and keeps us with God throughout our lives

and in the hereafter for eternity.

Conclusions

By now the reader has probably come to several conclusions regarding the
materials presented in this book. Various conclusions may have to do with
cultural and religious background of the reader. However, there are a few points,
I would like to make that are undeniably factual and must be taken seriously
and studied.

The formidability of the mathematics in this book is unquestionably and
unequivocally overwhelming and opens up a new window to the study of
numbers and the science of number theory which has not been seen or studied
before. The fact that Quranic parameters are generated with this mathematics
deserves further scrutiny and attention and may lead to new findings in number
theory as well as a better understanding of the universe.

Keeping these points in mind, we should then consider the possibility that a
book which is a literary manifestation of such a mathematics should be authentic
and the materials presented in the book must be true. Given this assumption,
we then must proceed to make a decision as to how we should deal with it.

Several options are at our disposal. We just may choose to ignore it, to

172
study it, or try to prove it wrong. In fact these options have been pointed out
in the Quran. If we ignore it, we should remember that the idea will not go
away and it will persist and grow. If we study it, it would be the best and if we
challenge its authenticity, we would encounter the insurmountable task of how
to deal with the mathematics.

Ignoring or challenging the book’s authenticity does not negate the fact that
the mathematics, which I have referred to as Ultimate Mathematics will not
be changed no matter what happens to us, to the Earth, to the Solar System,
to the Milky Way Galaxy, or to the entire Universe. Numbers pre-existed our
material existence and will outlast our demise and disappearance.

My own recommendation is therefore to study and try to learn from it. I did
study it and I learned a lot. Although, I am a scientist and more specifically
a physicist, I am not a number theorist, but I can say, without a doubt, that
the number theory presented in this book is well beyond the capability of any

number theorist and beyond the capability of mankind now and in the future.
