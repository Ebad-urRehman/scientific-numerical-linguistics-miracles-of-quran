This verse hints at two remarkable scientific ideas:
1. The **heavens and earth** were once united â€” like the cosmic singularity.
2. **Water as the origin of life**, consistent with modern biology.

### ðŸ”­ Scientific Insight
- The **Big Bang theory** suggests the universe started from a single point and has been expanding ever since.
- This was confirmed by **Edwin Hubble** in 1929 through the redshift of galaxies.

The Arabic word **"moosi'oon" (expanding)** beautifully aligns with this modern understanding.

## ðŸŒ  Scientific Timeline (Summary)
- **13.8 billion years ago** â€“ Big Bang occurs, universe begins expanding.
- **300,000 years later** â€“ Atoms form.
- **1 billion years later** â€“ Galaxies begin forming.
- **Present** â€“ Universe continues expanding at an accelerated rate (due to dark energy).

## ðŸ§ª Universe Expansion in Simple Terms
- Imagine inflating a balloon: the dots on the surface move away as it grows â€” like galaxies in our expanding universe.
- This expansion is still happening today â€” and accelerating.

## ðŸ§  Reflection
The Qur'an, revealed over 1400 years ago, spoke of the **creation** and **expansion** of the universe â€” facts discovered only in the 20th century.

> _"Then will they not believe?"_ (21:30)

Let these ayahs serve as a reminder of the signs in the cosmos that lead us back to our Creator.
