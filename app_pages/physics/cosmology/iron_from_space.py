## 📖 Surah Al-Hadid (57:25)
> _"We sent aforetime Our messengers with clear signs and sent down with them the Book and the Balance, that people may uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in which is strong material, as well as many benefits for mankind..."_

### ✨ Remarkable Phrase: "We sent down iron"
- The Arabic term **"anzalna"** (أَنزَلْنَا) means "We sent down" — often used for rain, revelation, etc.
- In this context, it indicates iron was **not originally from Earth**, but came **from space**.

---

## 🧪 Scientific Discovery
- According to modern astrophysics, iron is **not formed by fusion in stars like lighter elements**.
- It is created in **supernova explosions** — the **death of massive stars**.
- These explosions scatter iron across the cosmos — which later reaches forming planets, including Earth.

### ☄️ Conclusion:
- The Qur'an's claim that **iron was "sent down"** aligns perfectly with astrophysics.

## 🧬 The Isotopic Mystery and Surah Connection
- **Iron has 26 protons** in its nucleus.
- Surah **Al-Hadid (The Iron)** is the **57th surah** in the Qur'an.
- The **abjad (numerical value)** of the Arabic word **"Hadid"** is also **26**.

### 🔢 Isotopes of Iron:
| Isotope | Protons | Neutrons | Abundance (%) |
|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Fe-54   | 26      | 28       | 5.8            |
| Fe-56   | 26      | 30       | 91.8           |
| Fe-57   | 26      | 31       | 2.1            |
| Fe-58   | 26      | 32       | 0.3            |

- The most **stable and abundant isotope** is **Fe-56**.
- Yet the atomic **number 26** — the number of protons — is **universally fixed**, and it matches both:
  - The **position of Surah Al-Hadid** in the Qur'an.
  - The **abjad numerical value** of the word "Hadid" (حَدِيد).

## 🧠 Reflection
The connection between iron's cosmic origin and its Qur'anic mention opens a gateway to ponder the knowledge embedded in revelation.
