## 📖 Qur'anic Reflection
> _"So I do swear by the retreating stars—those that run and disappear."_  
> **Qur’an 81:15–16**

- The Arabic words **"al-khunnas"** (retreating, invisible) and **"al-jawār al-kunnas"** (those that run and disappear) hint at mysterious celestial bodies.
- Many scholars interpret this as a poetic description possibly aligning with **black holes**—objects that move and yet become **invisible**.

## 🌌 Scientific Concepts
### 🔭 **Black Holes**
- Massive collapsed stars that **warp space-time** and pull everything, even light, into their core.
- Observed through **gravitational effects** and radiation around the event horizon.

### 🌠 **Wormholes & Portals**
- **Wormholes** are theoretical bridges or tunnels through space-time that could connect distant regions.
- Some physicists suggest black holes might act as **one end** of a wormhole.

## 📜 Hadith Insight
> The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:
> _"The distance between one heaven and the next is **500 years**, and between the seventh heaven and the Kursi is 500 years..."_  
> **(Ibn Majah, Al-Tirmidhi)**

🪐 This layered structure resembles the **ringed model** of the observable universe—**nested layers** of heavens expanding outward.

- Implies **massive cosmic scales**.
- Consistent with today’s **multi-layered cosmology**: from planetary orbits to galaxies and superclusters.

## 🧠 Reflection
- Black holes may reflect Allah’s **invisible might**—a creation we can’t see, but whose presence warps reality.
- Portals and wormholes stir thought about the **unknown paths** in creation and journey of the soul.
- The layered structure of heavens reminds us of the **vastness** of divine creation and the **fragility of our place** within it.
