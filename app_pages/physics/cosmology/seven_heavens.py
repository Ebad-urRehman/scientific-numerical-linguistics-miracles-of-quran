### 📖 Qur'anic Verses

🔍 *"Ṭibāqan" (طِبَاقًا) implies a layered, ordered geometry — possibly concentric or dimensional.*

### 🧠 Reflections on Structure

- The term **"ṭibāqan"** clearly denotes **layers**, pointing to structured spatial or dimensional formation.
- Use of numbers (7, 500 years) suggests **precise design**, not metaphors.
- “Heavens without pillars you see” (31:10) points to **invisible forces** (possibly gravity, space-time).
