## ðŸ§­ Spiritual Parallel
Just as all creation revolves around a center:
- **Believers** revolve around **Kaaba** in Tawaf.

This harmony mirrors the **unity of creation** â€” everything created points to a **central truth and Creator**.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection
> _"Each one is traveling in an orbit (falak)."_  
> The word **"falak"** in Arabic means a **rounded path**, orbit, or celestial track. The term itself implies precision and center-focused design.

From the smallest atom to the galaxies, the universe is a grand system of **revolving creations** â€” all pointing back to a **central cause: Allah**.
