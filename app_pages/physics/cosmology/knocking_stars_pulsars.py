## 📖 Surah At-Tariq (86:1-3)

> _"By the sky and the night comer – And what can make you know what is the night comer? It is the piercing star."_  
> **Qur'an 86:1–3**

## 🌌 The "Tariq" — The Piercing or Knocking Star
The Arabic word **"Tariq"** (الطارق) comes from the root **ṭ-r-q (ط ر ق)** meaning "to knock" or "strike." In ancient Arab tradition, a visitor at night would knock on the door. Here, the Qur'an describes a mysterious star that appears during the night.

> **"An-Najmu Ath-Thaqib"** (النجم الثاقب) — literally means "the piercing star"

This is interpreted as a **celestial object that bursts through or penetrates**, perhaps with energy or radiation.

## 🔬 Scientific Insights
Some scholars associate this verse with:

- **Neutron stars** or **pulsars** — collapsed cores of massive stars that emit powerful, regular bursts of radio waves or x-rays. 
- These stars rotate rapidly and emit signals like a knock or a beacon — fitting the description of a "piercing, knocking star."
- Pulsars were discovered in 1967, over 1300 years after the revelation of the Qur'an.

## 🧠 Reflection
- The Qur'an challenges us to observe the cosmos and think deeply.
- A single word, "Tariq," captures a powerful cosmic phenomenon.
- Does the Qur'an hint at discoveries long before their time?

> _"Indeed, in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present [in mind]."_  
> **Surah Qaf (50:37)**
