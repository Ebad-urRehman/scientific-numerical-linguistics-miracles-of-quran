## 📖 Qur'anic Verse

**Surah As-Sajdah (32:5):**  
> _"He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth; then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count."_  
> *(Arabic: يُدَبِّرُ ٱلْأَمْرَ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ إِلَى ٱلْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِى يَوْمٍۢ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُۥۤ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍۢ مِمَّا تَعُدُّونَ)*

This verse speaks about a **heavenly command** or angelic ascent that takes **1,000 years of what humans count** — which many interpret as lunar years.

## 💡 Scientific Reflection

### 🌕 1,000 Lunar Years in Seconds

- 1 lunar year ≈ 354.36 days  
- So 1,000 lunar years = 354,360 days  
- Convert to seconds: 354,360 × 24 × 60 × 60 = **30,566,304,000 seconds**

---

### 🛣️ Distance Covered in That Time

Assuming the verse describes the **travel of angels** at the **speed of light (c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s)**:

- Distance = speed × time  
- = 299,792,458 × 30,566,304,000  
- ≈ **9.15 × 10¹⁶ meters**, which is **~1 light-day × 365.24 × 1000**

This implies the Qur'an mentions a motion equivalent to what **light would travel in 1,000 lunar years**, a remarkably accurate estimation of the **distance light would cover** over that time — long before modern physics.

## 🧠 What Scholars Say

Some classical scholars interpret the 1,000 years as:

- A **metaphor for divine timing** (i.e., Allah’s time differs from ours)
- A reflection of the **vast difference** between divine and worldly realms

Others suggest:
- The **angels** may travel at the **speed of light**, and this verse may hint at that speed.
