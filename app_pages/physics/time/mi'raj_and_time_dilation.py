### 📖 Qur'anic Verse on Mi'raj

**Surah Al-Isra (17:1)**  
> _"Exalted is He who took His Servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Seeing."_

### 🌌 Mi'raj and the Compression of Time

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ journeyed from **Makkah to Jerusalem**, then through the **seven heavens**, saw paradise and hell, met previous prophets, and returned — **all in part of a night**.

This aligns conceptually with the **modern scientific theory of time dilation**:

- According to **Einstein’s Theory of Relativity**, time moves slower for an object moving at or near the speed of light.
- While billions of events can occur in seconds from one frame, only moments pass in another.
- In Mi'raj, the Prophet ﷺ experiences a massive journey in what felt like an instant for people on Earth.

### 📜 Supporting Hadith

**Narrated by Anas (Bukhari)**  
> _“The roof of my house was opened and the Angel Jibreel descended... then he took me to the heavens...”_

**And another hadith (Bukhari 349)** mentions:  
> _"Between the heavens is a distance of 500 years..."_  
🔍 This may hint at **massive spatial and time differentials** between celestial levels — another allusion to **time and space relativity**.

### 💡 Reflections

- The journey's time frame and cosmic scale point to a **transdimensional travel experience**.
- Mi'raj may involve a **divine wormhole**, **folding of space-time**, or **acceleration beyond light** — all concepts entertained in modern physics.
- The event is a **sign**, as the verse emphasizes: _"to show him of Our signs"_.
