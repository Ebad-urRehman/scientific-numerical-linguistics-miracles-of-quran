## 📖 Qur'anic Verses Hinting at Earth’s Shape and Movement

### 🔄 **Rotation and Succession of Night and Day**

**Surah Az-Zumar (39:5)**  
> _"He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night..."_  
> *(Arabic: يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ)*

The word **"yukawwir"** (يُكَوِّرُ) in Arabic comes from **“takwir”**, meaning to coil or wrap around — as in wrapping a turban. This suggests a **spherical rotation**.

### 🌍 **Sphericity of Earth**

**Surah An-Nazi'at (79:30)**  
> _"And after that He spread the earth."_  
> *(Arabic: وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا)*

The word **"dahaha" (دَحَاهَا)** comes from the root **دحو**, which some linguists say means to **spread out** or to **make egg-shaped** (dahiyah = ostrich egg, which is slightly oval and spherical).  
This subtly reflects the **geoid shape** of the Earth.

## 🌐 Scientific Insights

- 🌎 **Earth is not a perfect sphere** but an **oblate spheroid** — slightly flattened at the poles.
- 🌍 Earth’s **rotation** causes:
  - Day/night cycle
  - Equatorial bulge
  - Coriolis effect

### 📈 Observational Proofs:
- Ship disappears bottom-first over horizon.
- Different constellations at different latitudes.
- Time zones and daylight shifts.

## 💡 Reflections

- These verses were revealed in a time when the Earth was widely thought to be **flat**.
- The Qur’an didn’t use common human perception but hinted at **scientific truth**.
- The use of precise Arabic words like *yukawwir* and *dahaha* supports deeper meanings.
