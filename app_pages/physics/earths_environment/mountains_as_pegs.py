## 📖 Qur'anic Verses

**Surah An-Naba (78:6–7)**  
> _"Have We not made the earth as a bed, and the mountains as pegs?"_

**Surah Al-Ghashiyah (88:19)**  
> _"And the mountains — how they are fixed firm?"_

## 🧠 Interpretation

The Qur’an compares mountains to **"pegs" (أوتاد)** — a term that implies anchoring or stability.

Just as **tent pegs** secure a tent by embedding deep into the ground, mountains have **roots extending below the Earth's surface**. This gives the land **stability**.

## 🔬 Scientific Perspective

Modern geology has found:

- **Mountains have deep roots** beneath Earth's crust — similar to icebergs.
- **Isostasy**: A principle in geology where the crust floats on the mantle like wood on water. Mountains help stabilize the crust.
- **Tectonic plates** collide and form mountains, which balance Earth’s crustal stress.

🔍 **Scientific term for deep mountain roots:** "Mountain roots" or "**crustal roots**"

## 💡 Reflection

- A 7th-century desert revelation described mountains using a term consistent with **modern geological insight**.
- The Qur’an invites us to reflect on **natural structures** to recognize **divine design**.
