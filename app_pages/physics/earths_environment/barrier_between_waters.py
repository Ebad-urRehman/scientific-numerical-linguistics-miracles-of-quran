These are real images where two different water bodies **do not mix instantly**, creating a visual divide as described in the Qur’an.

## 🔬 Scientific Explanation

Modern oceanography confirms:
- **Different salinities, temperatures, and densities** cause layers/barriers.
- **Halocline**, **thermocline**, and **pycnocline** form the invisible divider.
- These waters appear to meet but do **not fully mix** immediately.

## 💡 Reflections

- A 1400-year-old scripture described phenomena only discovered by oceanographers in the last century.
- These ayahs are **reminders of Allah’s control** over even the vastest parts of nature.
