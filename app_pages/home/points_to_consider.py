Quran is a divine book that states laws of morality, and how to live a life in this world for mankind. As believers we believe that Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ has created us, we also believe as the creation we have very limited knowledge, and Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ as a creator has the ultimate knowledge, he knows what's before, and after and we don't know. He know's what is the best code of living a life for human beings as an individual, and on a societal level, and He didn't leave us without guidance, He send Prophets to guide the people, and our Prophet Muhammad SAW, comes with the ultimate guidance for the people until the day of judgement. It is obvious that the creator knows which laws, and code of life is better for us, as compared to we can learn on our experience.

On one hand there is not doubt now that this book comes for our guidance, but this is the same book that also misguides, most of the peoples due to their own actions on the other hand. In Quran Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ says.

"He leaves many to stray, and guides many."

Now Allah is describing that he guides many people through examples of this book, and misguides many of them, also through this book, the next part of the Ayah is Important which says. And He leaves none to stray except the Fasiqoon(rebellious). This indicates their misguidance is because of their own deeds.

Allah عَزَّ وَجَلَّ also says that there is no doubt in this book, is guidance for those who are mindful of Allah.

Now myself, and everyone who is working on this app, or using this app must be aware of their intentions, and why they are going into the scientific, mathematical, and numerical study of Quran.

Before this we should be aware of context of all such studies, and how they mislead, and astray people from guidance. The problem is only with the intentions of such people, and how they are looking into the Quran is through the lens of science and mathematics, and numerology, instead of looking in Quran to derive science, and mathematics. Actually they are trying to fit the Quran in according to their understandings.

One such example is Rashad Khalifa an Egyption-American biochemist, In start he is trying to translate Quran in english, to understand the Quran himself, In the second Surah Alif Laam, meem, he can't find the meaning of it, so he insist to find something about these letters called Haroof-e-Muqatiat, so he put all of this  on the computer, and started to find the genuine patterns from the Quran, that in fact explains something about the Quran, and open up doors to a study the Quran from the new angle, The mathematical, and numerical patterns perspective.

In start these patterns go widespreaded, and Muslims all over the world has started to preach this new field as the ultimate proof that Quran is from Allah, and such a beautiful and precise placement of the words is not possible for any human being to made(which is a correct concept). Thus he has gain popularity, and come into arrogance so that he is trying to shape the Quran according to his desires and his wills, at start he is going through the angle of this Quran can't be changed due to it's numerical structure, but later he himself has tried to change the Quran according to the patterns he understand, as a result he has claimed that two ayah's in Surah taubah are not in the Quran, and thus he and his followers tried to remove them from the Quran. This claim is based on his theory that these ayahs are breaking the numerical code of 19 which he found in the Quran.

Thus his arrogance misguided him from the right path. 
            
Our purpose must not aim to shape Quran according to our wills and desires, but to understand Quran from our subject angle, and derive new formulas from the Quran.
