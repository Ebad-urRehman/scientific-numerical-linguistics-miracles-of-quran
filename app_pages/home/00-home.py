st.markdown("""
This app is dedicated to unveiling the profound and timeless wisdom of the Quran, revealed in the purest Arabic language. It highlights the unmatched linguistic miracle of the Quran that has challenged humanity for over 1400 years‚Äîno one has been able to produce even a single verse comparable in beauty, precision, and depth. Beyond its linguistic marvel, the Quran serves as an unambiguous, clear guide for humanity, offering lessons, moral principles, and signs (‚ÄúAyaat‚Äù) to reflect upon. These signs extend beyond scripture to the natural universe, inviting believers to explore scientific truths and the divine order underlying creation.
            
By bridging classical understanding with contemporary discoveries, this app aims to deepen faith (Iman), inspire intellectual reflection, and promote the application of Quranic principles to achieve moral excellence and intellectual advancement. It calls upon users to engage actively in deciphering the Quran‚Äôs signs and to embody its guidance for the prosperity of individuals and society at large.

Quran is revealed in Arabic language, so the right essence of Arabic is only understood by Arabic speakers.

At the time of revelations, it was the biggest challenge for the Arab world linguistically to declare the Quran as written by the Prophet, because according to them such beautiful, calculated, and precise placement of the words isn't possible by any human, yet they claim Quran to be written by Prophet, or someone from jews, and christians are helping Prophet SAW in writing this, so Quran replied them like.

Allah says in Surah Yunus Ayah 38:

This challenge of the Quran holds till now and until the day of Judgment no one on the planet can create even a single ayah like this, which is true from every perspective, and have a sea of signs to ponder upon it.
            
It is not the case that Quran is not understandable from the perspective of its lessons, morality, and principles. It is very clear in every aspect of what Allah wants from the human community.
Surah Baqarah Ayah 2:

st.markdown("""This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of AllƒÅh.

Now Allah is explaining how he give examples for the people to understand and accept. The people who believe this book is truth from Allah, will accept each and every ayah that Allah explains, and people who are fasiq will be misguided by the very same ayah, not because Allah misguides him but because they themselves choose misguidance by their actions.

In Surah Hud Ayah one Allah SWT talks about his Ayaat as well perfected, and well explained.""")

st.markdown("""
##### The word Ayah also encompasses general signs beyond Quranic verses.
Quranic verses are called Ayaat because they are signs of Allah, for the whole humanity, Allah SWT said about other ayaat that comes true later, that proof to them that this book Quran is true, and from Allah.""")

The Ayahs (signs) that people keep deciphering in the world are about scientific knowledge ‚Äî about how the world works, and on which mathematical codes the universe is sustaining itself with the command of Almighty Allah.

Such Ayahs (signs), when they come true through scientific discoveries, are then discovered mentioned in the Quran ‚Äî which was revealed 1446 years ago, When no one could even think about how these Ayahs (signs) would become clear in the future, they appear hundreds of years later in front of the believers. This increases their Iman and becomes a fascination towards working on a real great purpose ‚Äî That purpose is not just to explain the Quran in the best possible way to the whole world as a superior book, but also to achieve the peak of humanity by expanding intelligence through thinking and reasoning about the universe from the right direction, and to make the world prosper based on the principles of knowledge, morality, and power.

The Muslims of the past, and Sahaba Akram R.A., have understood these and applied these, which is a source of great knowledge for us.

Now, It is our turn to decipher the Ayaat of the Quran, and make people follow them.
