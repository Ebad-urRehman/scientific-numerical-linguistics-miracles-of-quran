> **"Mathematics is the queen of all sciences, and the universal criterion for finding truth."**

From ancient philosophy to modern mathematics, many great minds have considered **reason and logic** essential in the pursuit of truth. Here's what prominent thinkers and converts have said about **knowledge, truth, and the mathematical patterns within the Qurâ€™an**:

st.markdown("""
**Aslbek Mussin (Philosopher):**  
> "To find truth, we must first understand what knowledge is. Each of us possesses the necessary tools: senses, reason, and time. These help us seek answers about truth, knowledge, essence, existence, and reality."

> "Socrates was the first to show that truth can only be reached through reason. He equated good with knowledge, and evil with ignorance â€” making knowledge as necessary to humans as air, water, and food."

**Platoâ€™s Definition of Man:**  
> "Humans are featherless bipedal animals with broad nails, receptive to knowledge based on reasoning."

These classical views suggest that searching for truth is essential to our humanity â€” and **mathematics, as logic's younger sister, is at the heart of this search**.

st.markdown("""
**Dr. Gary Miller (Mathematician, ex-Christian missionary):**  
> "The mathematical structure in the Qur'an is too complex to be explained by coincidence. The statistical probability against such consistency is astronomical."

**Dr. Jeffrey Lang (Mathematician, University of Kansas):**  
> "What convinced me was not just one or two examples, but the sheer volume of these mathematical relationships throughout the text. As a mathematician, I recognize patterns â€” and these are not random."

**Professor Ahmed Deedat (Scholar):**  
> "The level of mathematical precision in a 7th-century text presents a fascinating area for interdisciplinary study that transcends religious boundaries."

**Dr. Elizabeth Maritenz (Computational Researcher):**  
> "I approached this as an objective researcher. What I found was a mathematical structure that raised profound questions about the origin of the Qurâ€™an.  
> Modern computing has only strengthened the case for the significance of these patterns."
