### 🌌 Qur'anic Verses about Creation in Pairs

The concept of creation in pairs is a recurring theme in the Qur'an, showing the balance and design in Allah's creation.

> **Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:49):**
>
> _"And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the grace of Allah)."_

> **Surah Yasin (36:36):**
>
> _"Exalted is He who created all pairs – from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know."_

These verses highlight:

- Pairs exist **in plants**, **humans**, and even **unknown aspects** (possibly hinting at atomic and subatomic phenomena).
- Allah created the world with **complementary systems** – male/female, day/night, positive/negative.

### 🧬 Scientific Reflection:
- **Genetics**: Every organism contains paired chromosomes.
- **Biology**: Male and female forms in plants, animals, and humans.
- **Physics**: Particles have corresponding antiparticles – a possible pair-based structure.

---

### 💡 Reflection for Believers
- Life is designed in pairs to show **interdependence** and **balance**.
- Pairs are signs of **purposeful creation** — not randomness.
- The verse ends with: "that you may remember" — urging us to reflect.

> "The more science discovers, the more it affirms what the Qur’an revealed centuries ago."
