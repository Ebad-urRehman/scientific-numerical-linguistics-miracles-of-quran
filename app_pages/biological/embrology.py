### 📖 Qur'anic Verses on Human Creation Stages

> **Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:12–14):**
>
> _"And indeed We created man out of an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a drop (nutfah) in a firm lodging (womb). Then We made the drop into a clinging clot (‘alaqah), then We made the clot into a lump (mudghah), then We made out of that lump bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought him forth as another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators."_

> **Surah Al-Hajj (22:5):**
>
> _"O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily We created you from dust, then from a drop of sperm (nutfah), then from a clot ('alaqah), then from a lump (mudghah), formed and unformed, that We may make it clear to you. And We cause whom We will to remain in the womb for an appointed time, then We bring you out as infants..."_

### 🔬 Scientific Explanation of Embryology Phases:

1. **Nutfah (Drop of fluid)**
   - Refers to the sperm and ovum – the fertilizing fluid.
2. **Alaqah (Clinging clot)**
   - Means something that clings or hangs. Embryo attaches to the uterine wall.
3. **Mudghah (Chewed-like lump)**
   - The somite stage of the embryo resembles a chewed substance.
4. **Formation of bones and clothing with flesh**
   - Skeletal development precedes muscular covering.
5. **Another creation**
   - Indicates the soul being breathed into the body and human distinctiveness.

### 🧠 Reflection:
- These stages described 1400 years ago align closely with modern embryology.
- Precise terms like **'alaqah** and **mudghah** point to observable phenomena now visible through microscopes.
- The verse ends with praising Allah — emphasizing the **miracle of human creation**.
