    Many Surahs are **chiastic** – meaning the structure mirrors around a central theme.

    **Example**: Surah Al-Baqarah**  
    - Begins and ends with guidance & belief  
    - Middle focuses on **changing Qibla** — spiritual direction

    This complex structure holds throughout, showing deep design.

    st.markdown("""
    In Surah Yusuf, the word **“king” (ملك)** is used, not **“Pharaoh (فرعون)”**, because Yusuf lived under kings of Egypt—not the Pharaohs.  
    But in Musa's story, **Pharaoh** is used consistently.

    This shows **historical accuracy** in word selection.

    st.subheader("3. Sound and Meaning Harmony")
    st.markdown("""
    Verses often use **harsh sounds** when talking about punishment and **soft sounds** for mercy.

    **Example**:  
    _"فَسَوْفَ نُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ"_ (We will ease him toward ease)  
    The verse itself sounds easy and smooth.
